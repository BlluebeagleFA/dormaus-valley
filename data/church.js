The confessional booth is rocking back and forth, and the growling and panting sounds are coming from within. You take a peek inside, and see a goat adventurer, his pants around his ankles and his furry rear shoved up against the side of the booth. On the other side, the wolf priest is ramming his cock into a hole between the pews, and slamming and thrusting forcefully into the blushing, bleating goat\'s ass. </p>The goat stammers something about being sorry for being such a bad bad guy, and the wolf priest growls with a feral, predatory intensity that makes you shiver. "Take my cock, you little slut, and I\'ll forgive you once your belly is full of cum." he says, his voice so rough and crude that you can\'t believe it\'s the same friendly, fatherly priest you met! The wolf snarls and drool oozes from his long fanged muzzle, and you can tell by the goat\'s bleats and shudders that his ass is being filled with hot cum. The goat starts to try to pull free, but Bonacieux rams forward so hard that he nearly crushes the wooden partition. </p>The goat yells in sudden pain as the wolf\'s swollen knot pops into his ass, tying him there until the priest is satisfied. His glowing yellow eyes turn to you, and he chuckles. "Shouldn\'t be spying, boy. You will need to be forgiven next!" he growls, and you back off, not sure if you\'re aroused or terrified.',

                        "text": 'You decide to attend one of Bonacieux\'s sermons, curious what the people of this town think about religion. Animals of all races slowly filter into the church and take seats in the pews. It seems to mostly be visitors, but you notice a surprising amount declined to wear pants to this event. After a short delay, Bonacieux walks out and moves up to the lectern, where he starts to talk about peace, forgiveness, and the loving embrace of the goddess of magic. It\'s all fairly standard stuff, but every now and then, the priest grips the side of the lectern with one hand, and growls in a very deep, suggestive way. </p>Towards the end, he starts to pant and moan through every other sentence, and you notice some of the congregation are stroking themselves quietly at their seats. You get curious, and carefully move up to the front-most row of pews, at the edge where you can just barely see past the lectern that the wolf is reading from. It looks like the wolf isn\'t alone up there. Kneeling between his legs and mostly hidden by the lectern is a ram, who\'s mouth is stretched open by an enormous wolf cock, while the wolf thrusts constantly into his face. Every now and then, Bonacieux reaches down, grabs the ram\'s horns, and yanks him forward to get a better grip as he deep-throats the wooly male. </p>Bonacieux ends his lecture with a rousing speech about treating people like they deserve, during which he pulls his cock out from the sheep\'s face, and howls as he sprays his wool down with cum, leaving the dizzy ram coated in dripping, sticky wolf jizz. Bonacieux then shoves him into the lectern and slides a panel down to conceal him, before putting his cock away and helping people leave the church. While he\'s distracted, you walk over to the lectern, intending to ask the ram if he needs any help. When he hears you talking, however, he baas and grunts. "Get lost! I\'m not trading places as his fucktoy with you! I love it down here!" he says. You shrug, and leave him be.',

                        "text": 'You hear a crashing sound from the back rooms of the church, and a growl of what sounds like anger. You push open a door and enter, wanting to check if something is wrong. Inside, you discover a long, thin weasel, with his hand inside a cabinet filled with valuable plates and gold items. Bonacieux clearly discovered him mid-theft, because he just slammed the door closed on the weasel\'s hand. </p>"Stealing from here? Unforgivable. You need a special punishment, my son", he says in a deep and rumbling growl. He picks up the weasel as easily as if he were a toy, then sits down in a large armchair, before opening his robe and lowering the black pants he wears beneath it. His long cock stands firm and erect from his grey fur, and the weasel yelps as the wolf starts to squeeze and stretch him. The weasel\'s body seems to stretch out like taffee as Bonacieux pulls him wider and wider, making him grow thinner, yet also somehow shrink. Soon, the wolf is holding a pencil-thin weasel as long as his arm, who is still wriggling and squeaking desperately. He winks at you. </p>"A little trick I learned back in my younger days", he explains. He smooths his moustache for a moment, then starts to wrap the weasel around the base of his cock in a spiral. As he does, the weasel\'s struggling and wiggling becomes slower, as his body starts to stiffen and harden. His brown fur begins to twinkle and gleam, as his flesh becomes smooth and firm, then takes on the gleaming burnished colour of gold. When the wolf finishes wrapping him around, the weasel\'s head is simply a golden lump with the carved image of a shocked weasel on it. It makes a very shiny and attractive cock ring on the older lupine\'s shaft. </p>He closes his robe again, hiding the trapped criminal, and gives you a wink. "Such is the justice of the goddess" he says, and you remind yourself never to piss off the big wolf.',

You walk into the confessional booth, and sit down. </p>A few moments later, the wolf priest Bonacieux enters the other side and closes the door. You can see his face through the grill. His long, furry snout is streaked with grey in the black, and his fur sticks out at the sides and chin in the shape of a soft and fluffy moustache, contrasting with the thinner fur atop his head. </p>"What troubles you, my child?" he says, his voice deep, soothing and fatherly. As you begin to tell him your worries, he nods, strokes his chin, and lowers his hands somewhere. You don\'t notice his motions, too focused on your confession. Finally, you are done, and you look over to the wolf, expecting some form of advice. </p>Instead, a small panel in the wooden partition opens, one that you hadn\'t seen before, and your eyes open wide as a long, fat cock is pressed through it. The wolf grins at you, his massive teeth gleaming in the dark of the booth. </p>"It sounds like you have been very naughty indeed, my child. I insist you redeem yourself, by debasing yourself." His voice is so deep and dominant that you can barely stammer out a response before you find yourself getting down and taking hold of the wolf\'s heavy cock. </p>His scent is masculine and virile, and you close your eyes and take him into your mouth. Your head slides forwards and backwards on the priest\'s lupine cock, your jaw aching to contain the massive manhood. He growls and urges you on as you suck. </p>"Yes, my child." "Faster, young one." "That\'s it, keep going, obey me." It doesn\'t take long before his voice descends into rough, rumbling growls, until finally he thrusts forward and howls. His cum explodes into your throat, so thick and so much that it spills from your cheeks and lips. </p>Once you have swallowed as much as you can, he slowly pulls away, and smiles at you. </p>"You are forgiven, my child. Return for confession whenever you wish.',
