It doesn\'t matter, the only package you can seem to care about is the enormous one between the legs of this handsome fox. </p>Your mouth opens as Flute thrusts forward, sliding his cock over your tongue and deep into your throat. He thrusts in and out, grinning and breathing heavily while your nose bounces against the pale orange fur of his pubes. His clawed hands grip harder on your head as he shudders and moans. </p>You feel his cock pulse, before thick, hot cum floods your mouth. You swallow every drop of his salty fluids, as it is pumped into you in thick and heavy spurts. Flute then pulls out, leaving you craving more. He pulls his pants off, gives you a wink, and leaves.
