As you\'re fighting to stay upright, Mikhail sits down on one of the boxes, and reaches down to tug off his heavy boot, revealing a footpaw that\'s covered with a sweat-soaked white sock, the soles gritty and stained with dirt. </p>You are forced to watch him slowly pull the sock down off his wide and powerful foot, and you can taste dry cotton in your mouth. Your skin feels rough and dry, and your insides feel empty and light.

Your limbs feel like they\'re fusing together, melting into the cotton tube of your body, leaving you completely hollow inside. </p>The handsome old dog walks over to you, his bare paw next to your limp body, then leans down and picks you up. </p>You dangle in his grip, until he sits down, leans forward, and stretches your mouth over his toes. As your body slides over his foot, you can smell his manly, mature scent, and taste his hard-working sweat. His toes wiggle deep inside you as you are wrapped completely around the old dog\'s foot, and then your vision is plunged into darkness when he shoves you back into the sweaty, hot, humid darkness of his leather boot. </p>You are forced to taste and smell the dog\'s foot, feeling his weight press down on you with each step as he returns to work.
