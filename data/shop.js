You didn\'t realise how tall he was. He looks down at you through his glasses, and leans forward. His moustache tickles your face as his long red tongue slides into your mouth. As he kisses you, his furry arm strokes along your chest, up and down, teasing and stroking you. Then it slides down to his pants, and reaches inside, to slowly pull out his cock. It stands proud and erect in the air, long and firm. </p>“Tell me you want it, son. Say you want daddy\'s cock.” You gulp and pant, then find yourself saying it out loud. “I want daddy\'s cock”, you stammer, and he growls with lust as he lifts you up, then pulls you down as he plunges his cock into your ass. </p>Your rear stretches around the older dog\'s shaft, and he growls a little as he thrusts in and out, his cock throbbing within you. Your heart pounds and your face is flushed with the pleasure of his shaft ramming your ass. You can feel your tailbone start to twitch, wiggling as it grows. It lengthens out behind you, and starts to wag from side to side, before growing fluffy fur. That same fur spreads up your back, where Mikhail strokes his clawed hands through it, admiring the same patterns and colours as his own furry body. Your face grows, pushing into his kiss as you grow a muzzle of your own. Your ears grow longer, develop fur, then flop over like a dog\'s. Your hands and feet throb for a moment, forming rough pawpads, and your nails become hard and sharp as they transform into claws. </p>Your whole body is changing, taking on aspects of your daddy\'s form, as you become a dog, the spitting image of Mikhail as a younger man. </p>He chuckles, and grips your shaft, stroking and pumping it as it turns red and pointed. The base swells out and inflates, forming a doggy knot, which he squeezes firmly in his hand. You whimper and bark with lust, and he growls at you. </p>“Cum for your daddy, pup.” You cannot disobey. You howl and bark, your cock pulsing and spraying out a thick load of cum into the air, that splatters over his shirt and over your furry chest. Then he holds you firmly and growls, and you feel his own cock release its musky load as a rush of heat deep in your rear. </p>You are left panting and dizzy, until he carefully pulls his cock free from your rear and allows you to stand. </p>“Good boy, son. You make your daddy proud.” he says. Your tail wags happily to hear your dad\'s praise.',
