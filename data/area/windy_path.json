Well aware of the deadly crossbow pointed at your skull, you lean forward and take the raccoon's shaft into your mouth.

His thick fluffy crotch is musky and warm, and he mocks and belittles you as you blow him. \"Yeah, suck harder cumslut. You love my fat cock don't you?\", he says, along with plenty of other slurs and insults. Finally he grips your head with his free hand and moans, as his cock pulses and unloads its hot, gooey load into your throat. He holds you down on it for a while afterwards, enjoying himself as he savours your humiliation. Then he backs off, gives you a wink, and hops back up onto his rock and out of sight before you can get revenge.

The wyvern leans down more to make it easier for you, and the tip of its ridged and pointed cock starts to ooze a powerful-smelling flow of precum. Its humping and thrusting, and the warmth of its hard cock, rapidly makes you sticky and sweaty. The cock starts to bob and twitch powerfully after you continue to rub, and one particularly powerful flex causes you to be thrown off, leaving you lying on the ground beneath the mighty beast. At that moment, it roars and stretches out its wings in pleasure, before its massive cock unloads a powerful blast of cum all over you.

As you wipe the cum off yourself, you notice the stains on the rocks around you. It seems this creature, unable to masturbate without arms of its own, has discovered that this particular spot is a good way to get some pleasure from the horny adventurers that pass by. As you try to stand up in the enormous pool of slippery cum, you feel your feet start to ache and stretch. Your toes grow longer and thicker, sliding through the cum and flexing as they become wide, powerful grasping talons. Your skin starts to toughen and become grey, before thickening and cracking into a set of leathery, rough scales. You try to back away, but you slip more in the cum, landing on your ass and spraying more of it over you. It soaks into your skin, and you feel your rear start to stretch out and throb. A long, muscular tail slides out behind you, moving through the slippery wyvern jizz. Your arms grow longer, and your fingers stretch out, thin and long and scaly. A web of flesh begins to grow down from your armpits, attaching your sides to your new longer arms, and you feel your neck ache as it pushes out and grows. Your face stretches into a fierce muzzle, and two horns ache as they arc out from your head, angling back and down along your new longer neck. You screech, in a loud predatory call, as your mind feels dumber and more instinctive.
