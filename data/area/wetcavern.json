Hold on though, still water doesn't make noises?</p>You turn around, and stumble as you see a glistening, writhing form emerging from the depth. Water cascades from a long, thick black tentacle, followed by more of them, curling and twining together.</p>As you try to back away, one of the tentacles lashes forward with blinding speed. It coils around your leg, the flesh squishy yet with a firm, inescapable strength. The skin of it is cold and slimy, and it wraps slowly around your leg as it drags you towards the water. You struggle, but the stones here are wet and slippery, and your motions only make you slide further down. Another tentacle grabs your other leg, pulling you in faster. The tentacles seem endless, a forest of powerful limbs dripping with water and slime.</p>The crawling tentacles writhe around your legs, then begin to coil around your waist as well. Your body is constricted all around by the cold and slimy limbs of this strange creature. Slime soaks your skin, making your flesh tingle and itch. The tentacle wraps around your neck, squeezes just enough to make you struggle to breathe, and then suddenly plunges deep into your gasping mouth. You feel its bulging flesh as it forces its way into your throat, deeper and deeper. You are helpless to fight it, even when you feel your feet sink into the ice-cold water. If you could, you would take a deep breath, but the tentacle prevents that. In one more sudden jolt, you are plunged into the blackness of the dark water.</p>You can see nothing, hear nothing. All you can feel is the tentacles as they touch and stroke your flesh. One of them slides between your buttcheeks, then its firm tip presses against your hole. You squirm as it enters you, filling you bit by bit, stretching your insides. The parts of your skin exposed to the water begin to go numb, and icy cold penetrates deep into your body.</p>You start to realise that you haven't taken a breath for several minutes. Your body doesn't seem to need it. This pitch-black water is somehow sustaining you. The coldness sinks deeper and deeper, filling you, washing away the heat and warmth of your beating heart and human flesh. Some other warmth inside you, some fundamental human kindness and joy, is slowly frozen over, and replaced by a cruel, inhuman, emotionless chill.</p>Your skin feels slimy and damp. The colour of it begins to change, becoming a flawless jet-black that glistens wetly. Your muscles harden and bulge, thickening and growing with incredible strength. Your fingers and toes grow longer and stronger, before hard and razor-sharp claws emerge from the tips. Between your digits, a thin, dark webbing forms, perfect for moving in the water.</p>Your hair starts to fall out, all over, leaving you slimy and cold and bald on every inch of your form. Your head bulges, growing round and large, as your mind races with new intelligence and knowledge. Your eyes glow a deep yellow, illuminating the water, where you see an infinite forest of writhing, thrashing tentacles. The tentacle in your mouth emerges, and you stretch your jaw as something seems to form on your face. Thick, fleshy points, growing long, and strong, and moving like fingers at your will. A set of huge grasping black tentacles, almost like a beard covering your lower face. You flex your new body, and swim to the surface.
