It's a fat reptilian creature, its four legs low to the ground, and its body stocky and strong. It smells strongly of a musky barnyard stink, with its brown splotchy body covered in thick hide instead of scales. The vehicle stops next to you, and the big lizard sniffs around before panting and showing off a long, dripping tongue. </p></p>\"Hey there!\", a voice calls, and you look up to see a slender rabbit grinning at you. \"Headed down to Otterton? It's a long and boring trip, but maybe I could help you out with that.\" he says. He points to his lizard beast, and the creature sniffs you curiously. \"I could do with a second puller. It's easy work, and you won't be doing much thinking. When I get to Otterton, I'll turn ya back and pay ten gold. What do you say?\", the rabbit says. You look down at the muscular, smelly beast of burden, and weigh your options. Do you want to try becoming one?",

He seems pretty shocked, but then he grins and bounces on his seat. \"Woah, two folks really want to become smelly mud-drakes? Well, I ain't complainin!\", he says. \"Easiest way to do this is let the big dummy here spread his change onto ya\", the bunny explains. He gets you to stand on all fours, your hands and feet sinking slightly into the damp mud on the road. The big brown lizard starts to get interested, and he bumps his huge scaly head against yours. His thick musk washes over you, as he clumsily and stupidly rubs and nuzzles you. His hot breath is damp and humid, and his huge tongue drools as he starts to lick at your face. His saliva is thick and slimy, and it makes your skin tingle. Your jaw starts to ache, as it stretches and pushes at your lips. You feel your teeth thickening and swelling, jutting out as they transform into massive fangs. Your tongue flops from your mouth as it grows, becoming heavy and wet. </p></p>You feel your body starting to grow heavier and stronger, as muscles grow and bulge under your skin. You posture shifts, your arms and legs becoming more bow-legged, and your hands and feet spreading out in the mud as they turn into thick, wide clawed feet. You feel your fingers and toes swelling and bulging, before you shudder at the feeling of wide, dull claws emerging from them and digging into the mud. Your body sweats heavily, the sweat dripping from your chest into the mud as you are surrounded by a smelly, raunchy barnyard stink. Your new aroma makes the other mud drake curious, and he clambers on top of you, his head nuzzling and poking your back as he crawls over your face. You look up and see his soft, scaly balls, and thick sheath-covered cock hanging in front of you. Your long wet tongue licks out instinctively as you taste him, savouring the beast's scent. You get a strange instinctive feeling of his health and emotions, like ball-licking is a form of weird communication between members of the kind of beast you are becoming.</p></p>The other mud-drake licks your rear, and you sway it gently as your tail starts to grow in. It thickens quickly, growing dull spikes and turning a muddy, earthy brown and red. It flops into the dirt behind you, before growing thicker and longer until it is almost the same size as the rest of your body. Your skin thickens and toughens, turning splotchy with the same brown-red markings as your tail.</p></p>As your changes complete, you feel your head growing foggy and slow. You blink lazily, your thoughts sluggish and stupid as your brain shrinks, and you take on the dump, complacent mind of a domesticated beast. You are still faintly clinging to your humanity, but it's like you're incredibly drunk. The rabbit pushes the other mud-drake off you, and then starts to fasten a halter around your chest. \"You still in there, bud? I hear it's a pretty nice feeling, having an animal brain for a while. Don't get too addicted though. The other guy asked me to make him go full-beast when we get to Otterton, and sell him off. I'll just put this ribbon on your halter so I know which of you to turn back later\", he says. He carefully wraps a little red ribbon around your leather straps, and you lick it curiously. He then climbs back onto his wagon, and shakes the reins. You and your partner walk forward, your strong legs easily pulling the small wagon as you do your duty.</p></p>The day goes by easily as you pull your load and do as you are told. Your simple mind doesn't get bored, it just feels happy to enjoy the sun and the feel of the mud beneath your claws. When the wagon master tells you you are doing a good job, you are proud, and you wag your tail. You are looking forward to doing lots more labour and being a good domesticated drake. It's only when you eventually see to the town of Otterton, your destination, that you remember that you're supposed to be turning back to normal soon. Your slow brain considers your options for hours as you walk down the valley towards the town.",

You rub your head, still dazed and dopey, as he presses ten gold into your hand. \"Thanks for the help, friend. I'll see you around!\", he says, before leading the other mud-drake off for sale.",

You then just pull your cart slowly and happily, and trundle into the plaza at the center of Otterton. Your tongue waves in the air as you taste the salty sea breeze. The rabbit hops down, and checks both your harnesses. \"Huh, good job I put this here, I almost got you two mixed up\", he says.

Earth-drakes are pretty expensive\", he says. You feel happy to know you'll be a good sale. He starts to rub and massage your thick neck, and stroke the sides of your head. You feel your brain slowing down more, your thoughts dropping away as you blink stupidly. Your memories and identity fizzle and sink to the back of your mind, then disappear. You lose understanding and sentience, forgetting concepts and ideas. You don't know what the things around you are called anymore. You can't comprehend language or thoughts. You just sniff and drool instinctively, as your brain shrinks to the tiny pea-sized mind of a dumb smelly lizard.</p></p>The furry soft thing pats your head again and makes noises at you.

These two are magic hunting dogs, guaranteed to find me a fox if I keep them out long enough!\", he says eagerly. You see his ears start to rise up, growing pointy and moving atop his head, while his hair starts to turn orange from the root up. You nod as he describes where he got the dogs from, and the two dogs grin in a very sinister way as they stand either side of him. His face pushes out into a vulpine muzzle, and his pants start to fall as a long, thick and bushy fox tail forms behind him. The two dogs start growling, and only then does he realise what's happening. Yipping in terror, he falls to all fours and runs off, the two dogs chasing after him.",

He drops his shirt, and kicks off his underwear, revealing his full naked, hairy, muscular body.</p></p>He then removes the rope from the cow's neck and takes off the cowbell she is wearing, before putting it on his own neck. Immediately, his cock and balls start to bulge and swell. His balls in particular inflate massively, the skin turning pink as they jiggle between his legs. Bulges form on the flesh, before they inflate out into milk-leaking teats. The farmer moos loudly, and small horns start to emerge from his hairline. White and brown spotted fur grows all over his body, and he rolls over onto all fours as his hands and feet stiffen and harden into cloven hooves.</p></p>Meanwhile, the cow is shrinking and rising up onto two feet. She adjusts her stance, as she becomes a thick and strong anthro cow, before pulling the farmer's overalls on, with her udder bulging from a gap in the front. She then walks off with her new cow on its lead.",
