He seems to focus on you, and looks surprised. \"Oh! There's someone else here?\", he says.</p>You ask him where you are, and what this place is. He looks around at the mirrors, and thinks for a while. \"This is the memory maze. I'm not sure where exactly it is, or how it exists. But there are a lot of mirrors here. If you can find the one that's yours, I think you can go home\", he says.</p>He walks with you through the mirrors. No matter how far you go, you don't seem to get anywhere new. The mirrors shift and move like reflections in broken glass. Showing fragments of lives of people you don't know or recognise.</p>\"I've been here a long time, I think. I don't remember anything about who I was before. Maybe if you find one of my memories, we could get out together? I will look for yours, too\", he says. He stops suddenly, and stretches his long neck up, looking up into the dizzying mirrors above you.</p>\"The stars are coming out...\", he mutters. You take one step too far, and as the mirrors shift, you lose track of him.",
