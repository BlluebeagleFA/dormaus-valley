In the center of the room is a brazier with a massive supernatural flame burning out from. The strangeness of the flame stems from how it\'s left half has the appearance of purple tendrils of fire, and the right a light yellow burning extremely bright, the two creating weird dancing shadows in the chamber. Lastly, on the left of the brazier is a throne made of twisting black metal with engravings of screaming faces of pain and terror that almost seem like they are moving in the dancing shadows. And on the right is a simple golden bench with a blue suede cushion on the top. [All content in this room came from CJMPinger]',

The burning scent of sulphur fills your nostrils, slowly going from a scent that brings about disgust to one that brings about arousal. As he moves toward you, you find it near impossible to avert your gaze from between his legs. His demonic cock growing rapidly to nearly double of the size from before. He finally stands before you, his erection at full mast in front of you. You then hear a single guttural command ressonates through your being, "Suck." Do you obey the monster before you?',

You feel yourself almost lose all control; your mind, body, and soul putty in his hands. Not entirely of your own accord, you mouth the word yes and lose yourself to his depravity.</p></p>You feel the clawed hand of the demon start gripping onto the back of your head, pushing you closer to that throbbing penis before you. Your lips pressed against the head and his scent overwhelming your nostrils. You open your mouth wide, barely enough to take in the girth before you as he thrusts in roughly, filling your mouth completely.</p></p>With the exception of the first thrust, he starts off surprisingly gentle. He moves slowly, letting every inch of the underside of his cock slide across your tongue. His precum smearing onto your tongue, sparking an immense need for more. A need to pleasure the demon and get your reward.</p></p>He starts getting a little faster, a little deeper, a little rougher. Bit by bit he slides further in. If you could look up, you would see a sly smile on his face, but you are far too obsessed with what\'s in your mouth as he continues humping. His speed and force begins to increase rapidly, all while pushing your head against him.</p></p>Soon his large cock is all the way down your throat, pumping in and out, ignoring any gag reflex you still may have. He continues thrusting, even harder than before, the rest of your face crushed against his groin. All pretense of care and gentleness are gone as the demon nears his climax. You feel as if your jaw and neck could break at any point, but they never do.</p></p>Then he bucks one last time forcefully into your mouth, and relaxes. Spurt after spurt of seed begins to flow out into your mouth, unable to swallow and helpless to contain it all no matter how much you try. Little streams of glowing red cum flow out of your mouth, hot enough to sear a person normally but leaves you unharmed. The demon then slides his cock out of your mouth, spraying a few weaker spurts on you, and goes back to sit on his chair to watch the coming changes.</p></p>You begin to feel extremely cold, despite all the burning seed inside and around you. It feels almost feezing, your body shivering with cold. And then you see a small ball of light exit out of your chest, and float toward the demon, his maw open wide. You try and weakly move your arm out and catch it, but you can barely move at all. It finally floats in and lands on the demons tongue, and with a single gulp it disappears, with one last shiver resonating through your body.</p></p>Then everything becomes hot, burning and searing throughout body, your screams echoing in the cave. Promptly this is followed by silence as your body begins to shift in size. All pain gone, you start to feel strong. Your mind and body becoming twisted. You stand with a smile, your skin already turning a deep shade of red.</p></p>You smile at your predicament, you know that you are changing quickly. You know that you are changing into something better, no... far superior, than everything else except Master Asmodeus. Tiny nubs of horns begin to grow out of your skull. All while you begin to become shorter.</p></p>From above your ass a long tail rapidly flings out, tipped with an almost Arrowhead like shape. From your back tiny wings unfurl, too tiny to allow you to fly more than a couple feet off the ground. Additionally you shrink more and more til you are less than a meter tall.</p></p>In the end, in the place you once stood, remains a pudgy little imp. Your belly slightly chubby and arms and legs lanky, all you do is grinÂ  as your inflated ego tells you that you are better than everyone else. Except for Master Asmodeus, of course.',
