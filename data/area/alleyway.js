His pink tail curls around your ankle as he asks you whether you\'d like to make a bit of gold. You hesitantly agree, and the rat immediately presses you against the alley wall. His long hand strokes along your chest as he licks and kisses your cheek. "Gets lonely out on the job. Glad I found a good hole to fill." he mutters. </p>He pulls down his pants, revealing a grey-furred sheath and a rock-hard cock. With a rough shove, he rams your belly to the bricks of the wall, and starts to rub and squeeze your rear. His cock teases and presses against your hole, before he shoves forward with a lusty grunt. You feel his long muzzle against your cheek, and the heat of his body pressing against you. His hands are rough as he wraps his arms around your body and strokes your chest. His breath is panting and hot, as he thrusts and shoves himself deep inside you. You pant too, and gasp as the rat rams into you over and over, his motions getting faster and more intense. His breathing gets ragged, as the pent up lust he has had for weeks begins to build up. His eager hands hold you tightly to him, and he thrusts as deep as he can, completely hitling his cock inside you.</p>With a mixture of a moan and squeak, he fills your ass with hot, sticky cum, then shudders and sighs. Pulses and gushes of heat fill your rear, as he cums again and again. Finally, he pulls out, his cock still oozing cum. "Fuck, I needed that! Thanks, hot stuff", he says. He winks at you, and places a bag of coins in your hand, before pulling his pants up and walking away.',

                        "text": 'Muffled voices and rustling activity draw you towards some activity in the back streets. It\'s not long before you find Flute leaning casually forward. He sees you approach, a rogueish gleam in his eyes, "Another customer, or just here for a social visit? I\'ll be right with you my friend, just attending to some business." </p>In the instant he turns away you can feel a change in the atmosphere. A tension that makes one hair stand on end. A fluid change that seems to come easily to the fox, polite one moment and serious the next, all while keeping the same shark-like smile. It becomes easier to understand why the smaller fox might be able to keep the taller wolf cornered like he has. </p>The white wolf cringes, tail tucked between his legs. A visible tent eagerly bucking in his pants. You see the firm erection bouncing up and down, as if trying to escape itself. </p>Flute smirks, "Let this be a lesson, no one gets anything for free." You\'re not quite sure if the wolf stole something, or was merely late on a payment. You just silently watch the back alley merchant claim his due. </p>You watch the fox\'s paw slip inside the wolf\'s pants. The tall wolf whines, claws grazing the brick behind him. He is trapped, like cornered prey unable to escape. The bigger wolf seemed helpless as the fox worked. You see Flute\'s paw moving and groping around. The wolf\'s legs shift, his knees  bowing and turning inwards. You\'re not sure what exactly is going on inside the wolf\'s pants,  but you can\'t help but sense the raw sexual power of what\'s going on. Just by watching you feel your gut tighten in sexual arousal. Flute working over the panting wolf is turning you on. </p>The white wolf throws his head back, squirming against the wall with a muted, stangled whine he tries to keep restrained. Flute withdraws his paw from inside the wolf\'s slacks. You stare wide eyed at the sticky clear trails of fluid the connect the fox\'s brown paw with the inside of the wolf\'s pants. The gooey strands unbroken. "Transaction complete, if he wants to reclaim what\'s his he can pay me what he owes me." Flute turns to you with a playfilly sinister grin, "Feel free to come by my shop, my prices are always fair, or perhaps maybe you\'d like a taste of the same? I promise if you do I\'ll be more gentle then I was with our friend here." </p>Flute jerks his head back to the wolf, smearing the fluids on his shirt before walking away with a smirk. The already blushing wolf\'s eyes widen, the laces of his breeches come loose. Whether a deft act by the sly fox, or a mere consequence of their activity, you watch his pants come down. The laces loosen as the soaked pants and underwear succumb to gravity. Giving you a clear view between the wolf\'s legs. </p>A very masculine wolf stands before you, panting and winded against the wall. His cheems red as he tries to steady and collect himself. His knees quiver as he tries to stand. He shudders and pants as if he has run a marathon, or had just stumbled out af a bedroom after a full night of sex. The "he" you realize might be a relitive term now. Between his powerful thighs what you see is anything but male. It seems Flute left him male everywhere except where it counts the most. All you see between the wolf\'s legs is a quivering needy pussy where not moments before you had seen a proud erection straining at his slacks. </p>The wolf gives you one look in the eye, his fur practically turning pink from his burning blush. His ears lay back against his head as his eyes dart away, a act that shows his shame, but perhaps that enjoyed what just happened more than he wishes to admit. </p>You turn back to see Flute\'s tail disappear behind a corner. The fox unapologetic as he struts away, cheerily humming to himself. You turn back to do a doubletake of the wolf. The white lupine stumbles away, holding up his pants as he staggers off in shame and humiliation. Leaving you with more questions than answers, but none bigger than this. What would the fox do to you if you crossed him...or perhaps...even let him? (Guest event written by Fahlma)',

                        "text": 'Mikhail the dog is here, standing next to a large stack of wooden planks and looking up at the roof of one of the nearby buildings. He strokes his chin and appears to be thinking carefully. You walk over and ask him whether he has a problem. He looks over at you and smiles as though he just had an idea. "Oh hey there kiddo! See that roof up there? It got damaged real bad during that last big storm. I was just thinking I need to sort it out, but my ladder is all the way on the other side of town. Care to give me some help?", he says. You assume he just needs someone to go fetch his ladder for him, but to your surprise, he tosses you a crumpled white cotton vest. You lift it up and are assaulted by a ripe, potent stink of sweaty, hard-working male body odour. "That used to belong to an old carpentry friend of mine. Put it on and we\'ll soon have this sorted out", he says.</p>You are starting to feel increasingly suspicious of all this, but you do want to help, so you pull the dirty, sweaty vest down over your head. It hangs incredibly loosely, and you start to feel strange. A pulsing, throbbing feeling of power and energy is flowing through you. Your muscles ache and bulge, feeling swollen with power. When Mikhail lifts one of the large planks and pushes it over to you, you instinctively grab it and hoist it into the air with ease. You slide it under your arm and hold it there, as if you\'ve done this a thousand times before, and then find yourself jumping up at the side of the roof. You grab onto the edge of the roof with your hand, as your skin starts to darken and toughen, becoming rough and grey. Your feet grip onto a pipe and onto the edge too, as your toes become longer, thicker and more muscular. Your feet spread out and grow, changing and shifting until they\'re more like hands.</p>You clamber up onto the roof like an ape, and place the board down over the hole in the roof. With your tough new hands, you remove the damaged tiles and set up the lumber as if you\'ve trained in carpentry your whole life. Black fur starts to sprout on your back, and down your arms. It grows in thick and shaggy, and as it grows, your arms seem to thicken with rock-hard muscle, but also grow longer and longer, until your normal posture leaves your knuckles almost dragging along the floor. The black fur coats the back of your hands, and moves down your legs to cover the tops of your feet, but your rough grey skin is still visible on your fingers and toes. Your chest bulges with muscle, and your belly starts to grow out, becoming round and firm. It forms a barrel-like grey chest, and your newfound strength makes it easy to hop down, grab two more boards, and clamber back up to continue fixing the roof.</p>As you work, more fur grows up your neck and along the edges of your face. It covers your cheeks and chin, but leaves your face furless. Instead, your features just become more rugged and ape-like, with a thick brow and a large, flat nose. Your teeth sharpen and grow, transforming into a gorilla\'s strong fangs, and your ears push out at the sides. With your changes reaching completion, the vest on your chest fits perfectly, with the sweat-stained armpits getting wetter from your exertion and effort. You hear Mikhail shouting from the alleyway. "Hey Brutus! Don\'t forget to line up the edges properly!", he yells. You snort. You have been friends for decades and he still acts like you\'re a journeyman carpenter! You shake your head and line up the last of the boards, then hammer in some new tiles, before hopping back down. As you land next to Mikhail, you scratch under your armpit and ook at him, asking if he wants to go get a drink after work. He smiles and nods, but as you turn to head to the bar, he grabs the hem of your vest and pulls it up over your head. Suddenly, your mind swirls and your old memories return. You\'re not Brutus, the gorilla! You remember who you are and feel very confused for a moment, as the spirit of the gorilla carpenter still echoes in your mind. Mikhail slaps your back and thanks you for a job well done, and for a moment you still reply in Brutus\'s voice. It might be a little while before you\'re back to your old self.',

She has light, wrinkly skin, piercing yet kind blue eyes, and wispy grey hair tied into a bun on her head with a light pink bow. She is wearing a brown patchwork dress, with plaid patches sew in the fabric. When you fully turn around, facing her she begins to speak up, excited and ecstatic. "I’m Linda, a tailor in town. I’m more of an Artist though." She pronounces Artist in such a pretentious way that you can actually hear the capitalisation. "Much better than that drivel you see people getting from that stupid fox or that walking father complex of a shopkeep. Besides, my stuff is more beautiful and Avant Gar- Oh, look at me ramble!" </p>You look at her incredulously, wondering what she even wants with you. When she sees your gaze, she coughs and then straightens out her dress before continuing. "When I saw you, I couldn’t help but think of what clothes would look good on you. If I could trouble you for a few moments, may I try some of my masterpieces on your body? You’d make the perfect stand in for one of my mannequins!" Do you accept her offer?

Inside it looks like an average clothier’s, with the exception of all the mannequins. They are all strangely unique. Some are big, some small. Some human, others different morphs and creatures. Some male, others female. And all of them wearing surprisingly erotic clothing. You stand there staring at all the mannequins and clothing around, wondering about the whole sight. After a couple minutes of you standing there, transfixed, you hear Linda says, "Hey, over here!" When you look over, you see a pedestal surrounded by mirrors and the old lady standing beside with a pile of black leather clothing in her arms.</p>You walk over to stand on the pedestal and look at yourself in the mirror. When you see Linda about to try and drape a leather BDSM jacket on you, you try to say something about how she hasn’t measured your size yet. Before the words even leave your mouth, she whispers in your ear, "Good mannequins are silent." Your mouth shuts up tight, no matter how much you try, not a single sound escapes your mouth. As you begin to thrash around, ready to run out of the studio, she yells in a commanding manner "Stop Moving!" You freeze where you are, unable to move a single inch, even your breathing being halted completely. "There, that’s better. Mannequins aren’t supposed to move, are they?" she says, looking you straight in the face. You stand there terrified, but with a strange arousal inside of you.</p>Linda then proceeds to push down your arms and legs back into a uniform position above the pedestal. No matter how much you try, you stand there petrified. Even your face remains frozen, leaving you staring in horror at what she is doing to you. She lifts your arms and puts on the jacket from before. It fit’s snug against your body, and soon you start forgetting things and calming down. At first it’s small things. Like where you are, whoever this nice lady clothing you is, and why you can’t move. But soon you start forgetting more and more. Your name, your past, your life before you were standing here. All gone into an abyss, inaccessible to your mind. You feel as if you should be worried, but you can’t seem to bring yourself to care, your thoughts beginning to slip away. You don’t even notice when she lifts your legs, one leg at a time, and slips on a pair of tight leather shorts.</p>When she is done "clothing" you, she stands back to appraise her work. A single wrinkled finger on her chin, she stares at you thinking. "It needs something more, to fit the ensemble…" You see, without even truly comprehending anything, Linda go to the backroom of the studio. While she is gone, your body begins to change rapidly. Your skin flattens and hardens into a hard plastic, smooth to the touch. All discernable features flatten into the plastic, becoming even more still and lifeless. All while this happens, your thoughts disappear completely. By the time Linda returns, all that is left is an empty husk. Mindless and still, a mannequin stands where you once were. Linda slips onto the front of the new mannequin a studded leather collar with a single chain link on the front to finish the outfit and exclaims, "Marvelous, another Masterpiece to put with the others!"',
