Your mind feels calm and at ease, stresses and worries clearing away as your face reshape itself into a panther’s. Your fingers tingle, claws growing at the end of each of them, with soft pads forming on your palms. The fur spreads further down to your feet, short claws forming on each toe and soft pads developing on your soles.</p>After finishing your cigarette, you stuff it into the ashtray. Without a word, Alder grabs your head and kisses you. A final wave spreads through your body. Your eyes turn amber, a tail extends out from your tailbone, and you immediately feel a sense of satisfaction with your form. You stare into each other’s eyes and rub your noses together, licking each other’s face every now and then in a trance of love.",

                        "text": "You nodded meekly. “What’s that? You’re gonna have to speak up.” Alder wore a cheeky grin, teasing your cock further with his boot. You told him yes, loudly, and the grin turned into a twisted smile. “That’s what I want to hear…” Without warning, he pushed you onto your back and began to grind his boot into your erect member. It was humiliating and hurt a little, but it also felt so good; you were weak, pinned to the floor by pleasure alone, with a massive sadistic figure looming above you in full control.</p>You tried to sit up, but all it took was for him to place his boot on your chest, and you were once again turned back into a doormat. Your fur got dirty with traces of mud and what else was on the boots; and yet, you loved it. You whimpered his name, which only had him smiling even more sadistically. It went on and on, intensifying by the minute until, like a balloon popping, you blew your load all over his boots. He didn’t stop, milking you and continuing to do so well past the point that it became post-orgasm torture. ‘I control you’ it said, ‘I own you’. You had no escape, not that you really wanted it.</p>“Now you went and dirtied my boots… What will you do about that, my kitten?” He raised his boot up to your face. The treads themselves looked like standard affair, deep enough that they’d leave clear bootprints if he walked on wet soil. He was showing you something more obvious though: the coating of your cum now mixed in with the dirt inside the treads. “What are you waiting for? Get cleaning.” And so you did. Tasting your own cum was humiliating at best. Your diet is pretty poor, so it didn’t taste all that good either. You were almost happy when all that was left was dirt for you to lick up. You swore to eat more fruit from this day on. It took a fair few minutes before you’d lapped it clean, literally spit-shined.</p>“Kiss it. Worship me.” The panther commanded clearly. You looked up for a split second and saw him pawing himself off, staring down at you and panting faintly. You felt instinctually compelled to obey… it felt so good to obey. The taste of cum and dirt lingered in your mouth, though it was faint and easily overtaken by the leathery taste of the boots. You praised him verbally, telling him of how magnificent he and his boots were, and soon enough your erection grew back again, recovering from the previous ordeal. You were entranced by the boots, you wanted to worship and praise his boots all day… but he interrupted you quite rudely, pushing you away with his boot once again.</p>“Go fetch a cigar. Closet, second drawer from the top. Get to it.” He snapped his finger, and you immediately scurried over and searched the drawer. Inside were ballgags, dildos, handcuffs, and many other BDSM tools you couldn’t recognize — though you had an idea of how they’d be used. You found a pack with two cigars left inside and took it back to Alder. He rolled it around in his fingers and grinned. “Now go fetch another.” You’d already forgotten where it was by now, and the drawer was ever so messy. You came back with another one, and he’d already lit the first one.</p>“Ahhh… These’re are pretty expensive… You should be happy you’re given a chance to smell them…” He blew a cloud of smoke down into your face, and it did indeed smell good… almost hypnotically so. “Actually… I just had you fetch that one because I could. Go place it back. Now.” The grin on his face made it clear he was enjoying this. Provided, you couldn’t really complain — your obvious and exposed erection made it hard to hide how much you enjoyed it yourself.</p>When you returned, he stood up and pointed down at the floor. “Stay.” His order resonated in your mind. You stared down at the floor, and all you could hear were heavy footsteps moving away, the shuffling of a drawer, and then footsteps again getting closer and closer. They ceased, and after moments of silence, he began to scratch behind your ears. “Who’s a good kitty? You are… Close your eyes, kitty…”</p>Darkness enveloped you… Or rather, something black covered your eyes. You felt straps behind your head tightening. It didn’t take a genius to guess what it was. “There we go… Kitties look so much cuter when they can’t see a thing… Totally reliant on others…” He began hooking your mouth with his fingers, sometimes shoving one further down and toying with your mouth. He held your mouth wide open and shoved a red ballgag in. “Aaand now you’re mute, good… Try speaking.” You tried; all that came out were muffled sounds and moans.</p>“Now for the last part… I’m gonna need you to cooperate a bit here.” He took one of your handpaws and pushed them into something warm and soft. You had to clench your hand into a fist to make it fit all the way. He did the same with your other hand. You heard two loud clicks — the sound of a lock — proceeded by a snicker. “You look cute with those on… So helpless…” Your handpaws felt a bit heavier than usual, and when you tried to touch your chest with them, you felt a thick layer of something around your fists.</p>He reached around you and… hugged you? No, that was not it. You felt your entire body become light as he lifted you up in the air before placing you onto something soft — presumably his bed — and laid down on top of you. He whispered seductive words into your ears, “You look so helpless, so weak… You’re mine to control and nothing you do now could change that…” and he rubbed your face gently. “And I’m gonna use you all night…” You feel something sharp stab into the side of your neck, something went running down it just after. You tried shouting out in pain, but the gag muffled it — no one would hear it. “Yes, that’s it… Scream for me all you want…”</p>His warm tongue went up your neck, presumably licking up blood. “You’re such a tasty treat, I could almost eat you…” With his tone, you thought for sure that was a death threat. “But I won’t… You’re just too cute…” He leaned in and whispered soothingly into your ear, “Am I going too far? Do you want to continue? Just nod your head..” You were scared, and for a split moment you had thought he was actually trying to kill you, but you had to admit… you were turned on, and you thought you could trust Alder. As you nodded, you heard the panther chuckle a little.</p>He wrapped his hands around your throat and squeezed it slightly, massaging your Adam’s apple with his thumbs. “It’d be so easy to take you out now… You could do nothing to stop me…” His tongue went up your neck again. “But I don’t kill… At least I haven’t yet.” Even if you trusted him, Alder sounded so incredibly threatening that it had your heart beating, blood pumping, and adrenaline rushing. Even if you were a panther just as him, he was a predator, and you were simply his prey.</p>His hands roamed down your body landing on your pecs, which he squeezed tightly. “You’re so much hotter now that you’re a panther… I’m glad I made the decision to transform you…” He licked at your neck again and began playing with your nipples using his thumbs, flicking and teasing them, circling around them, all of it arousing you.</p>“It feels so good to be a panther too, doesn’t it?” You could only nod, but that was all he needed from you. He reached his hand down your chest, down your stomach, down to your throbbing cock. He squeezed it; almost as if he was saying ‘this is mine’ while he grinned. Stroke after stroke, your body exploded in pleasure; you couldn’t help but squirm, but you also knew it was futile in your current state.</p>You felt the edge come near, and then… just disappointment. His hand moved away, and he licked your neck once again. “Aww… did my kitty think he would get his reward yet? Not yet~ Tell me how badly you want it…” You tried to, but the gag was in the way: you couldn’t speak. “Hmm… I can’t hear you~ Try speaking a little louder, my kitten…” This was cruel. You loved it.</p>His hand reached down again and stroked you off again. His hands were strong, they took control of your primal urges. This time you could feel it get even closer, he went even farther, until you felt the first pulse… and then a looming sense of dissatisfaction. You felt your crotch shake and thrust, you could feel yourself ejaculating, but there was no pleasure; in fact, it felt quite the opposite, overall dissatisfaction and displeasure: an anti-orgasm.</p>“There~ we go… Did my kitty like cumming?” You whimpered into your gag. You felt bad all over — it certainly hadn’t felt like an orgasm, but you did in fact cum. “That’s what they call a ‘ruined orgasm’, kitten… Emptied out, but no pleasure. Because I control you right now. You won’t feel pleasure unless I want you to, and you like that, don’t you?” You shook your head. This was too much, you could almost throw up.</p>The blindfold and gag were taken off almost instantly, Everything was bright, but you could see his worried face. “I’m sorry, I went too far this time.” He began unlocking the bondage mittens on your hands, removing the last piece of bondage on you. “Just lay there and I’ll get a towel. Also, please don’t look-, just close your eyes and wait.” Curiosity took the better of you, and you looked down your body. It was covered in your own cum and… blood all over your chest. Your breath got erratic, you felt scared.</p>Alder leaped over and covered your body with a damp towel — presumably prepared beforehand — and began wiping up all the bodily fluids all over you. “There there, it’s okay… I didn’t bite into any vitals, you’re okay, just relax.” He spoke quietly, taking a moment to look into your eyes, making sure you saw his sincerity.” Not long after, he threw the towel on the floor. Your body was clean, and the puncture in your neck had healed, no longer making a mess.</p>“I know what will make you feel better, sweetheart.” He began taking off his leather gear, stripping himself bare. His physique was almost exactly the same as yours — you’d be hard pressed not to think you were staring at your own mirror image. Before you even had time to glare all over his body, he laid down in the bed with you, hugging you tightly. “It’s okay to be scared. I went too far — you’re not used to this stuff like I am. Just relax and we’ll cuddle.”</p>His body was warm. You wanted to be as close to him as possible; every inch of his body was a source of calmness as it rubbed off on you. He shuffled himself higher up and held your face in his chest. “You did great, and I’m proud of you. I’m here — I’ll protect you.” With each word, you found yourself feeling more at ease. You could hardly remember how you felt before. You were calm and relaxed. Your eyes felt heavy, so you closed your eyes. Everything was warm, soft, gentle… it lulled you to sleep. A deep deep sleep, one that would leave you happy and refreshed.</p>You woke up the next morning, still tightly in Alder’s embrace. ‘I could stay like this forever and ever’ you thought to yourself, though a growl from your stomach had you reconsidering that. You didn’t think it was that loud, but it seemed to wake Alder up. “Did you sleep well?” You replied quietly, and his face beamed up. “I’m glad to hear that. Want to go get breakfast? I think everyone in Dormaus could hear your stomach.” Your face turned beet red from the remark, and he laughs a contagious laugh.</p>After a morning cigarette, you got yourselves dressed and headed over to Saberhagen’s bakery for some morning pastries. You had come just in time to get the last few pastries; lucky!",
