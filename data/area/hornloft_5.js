It's a bit heavier than you'd normally try, but you could probably manage a couple at this weight. It will at least be a way to pass the time.</p>You push up hard on the bar, your arms aching and straining, and then slowly lower it back down. You're panting and grunting, but it feels kinda...good. You do another one, and it feels a little easier this time. Your muscles feel so good as they strain and bulge, and your skin feels warm from the exertion. You do another, and another, getting faster and easier, like it feels natural to push and strain this way. Your prison shirt is getting damp with sweat, and feels scratchy against you, so after another pump, you sit up and pull it off. Your chest is looking great, with visible, defined muscles, and your arms are so big and strong. Were they...always like that? Doesn't matter. Gotta pump!</p>You sit back down, gritting your teeth, and start to push again. Fuck, the weights have gotten heavier somehow! But that burn feels sooo good. You growl and push, pumping and straining, your mind filled with nothing but the thought of working more, getting bigger, the pleasure of working out.</p>This time its your pants that feel scratchy and wrong. You stop for a moment, stroking your hand down your ripped, powerful chest, and push your pants down. Naked is how you should REALLY work out. Show off those awesome muscles. Let the air dry your sweat and everyone smell your strength! You don't realise that your thoughts are slow and its hard to focus, or that you have a dumb grin on your face. You sit back down, and see the weights have gotten bigger again. Awesome!</p>You push up, and feel your mind empty and relax. Don't need to think. Lower down, and you grin dumbly and happily. Push up. It's good to be strong, and not think too much. Lower down. Thinking hard. Push up. Just let guards do think for you. Lower down. You dumb. Guards good. Guards know what best for you. Push up. You good prisoner. Lower down. Durr. Push. Lower. Push.…</p>Hours later, the whistle goes off to signal rec time being over. A gryphon guard walks over to you, and strokes your bare chest with his rough hand. \"Hey, big one. Time to head back\", he growls. You smile at him dumbly, and he ties a rope around your neck, before leading you back to your cell like a cow on a lead. You follow him, feeling your huge awesome muscles, and thinking how lucky you are to have guards to tell you what to do.",

They are led by a fat, dominant polar bear who treats the rest of the gang like his personal paw-rubbing harem.</p>Inside the prison you won’t be able to transform due to the magic-cancelling stone walls. Out here in the yard you have a much better chance. Though it does mean you’re going to have to suck up to the gang.</p>They’re all sitting around a bench in the corner of the yard. Rock the polar bear is sitting on the bench, his fat white belly bulging out of his uniform. Roland the arctic fox is sitting on the bench, while Archie the slender ermine is nuzzled at Rock’s massive white furry paws. You approach, and Rock is the first to notice you. He leans back, crosses his massive arms, and grins. \"Well well well gang, look what we have here. A frostbiter!\", he says in his rough, deep voice. Roland and Archie giggle and Archie says \"Yeah yeah!\" in a snivelling sort of way. Reluctantly, you get on your knees, and Rock lifts an eyebrow. You beg them to let you join their gang, because you have finally truly understood the superiority of their fluffy, cold-resistant forms. Rock's wide muzzle stretches into a big grin as he leans down and grabs you, pulling you forward.</p>Your face is shoved firmly into the polar bear's crotch, and you feel his thick bear cock shifting and starting to harden in his pants. He smells of musk and sweat, his huge lumbering body warm and thick. \"Alright, new fish. Prove how much you love and worship our superior bodies. Serve us, and forsake your weak, warm-weather form for the mighty of the glorious winter frost!\", he booms.</p>You obediently pull down his pants, and his heavy, thick black cock emerges. You start to nuzzle and kiss it, rubbing your face over his musky sweaty shaft, and feeling the swollen head ooze pre. He starts to pant and huff, clearly loving the sight of your obedience. As you slowly take his cock into your mouth, you feel someone grab at your pants. Archie, the long fuzzy ermine, has pulled your pants down, and climbed up onto your rear. His small claws dig into your sides, and you turn to see his mischievous grin as he presses his furry noodle body against you, and thrusts his crotch against your rear. You feel his long, hard weasel cock ram into your ass, but your yelp is muffled as Rock takes hold of your head and forces it deeper onto his massive shaft, making you gag on it.</p>Roland the fox remains on his bench, stroking himself through his pants as he watches you get used from both sides. As Archie slams into you, you feel yourself changing. Your body tingles and feels itchy, as thick white fur begins to sprout all over you. It thickens and becomes a fluffy pelt, rapidly covering you with snowy white fur. Your body cracks and shifts, becoming longer and thinner. Your tailbone aches, and stretches, growing out longer and longer, as it develops fluffy fur of its own, and becomes a long white weasel tail. Your hands and feet stretch, as small claws begin to form, and your soles and palms become padded and smooth. Finally, your face stretches out over your boss's cock, becoming pointed and fuzzy, and your ears stretch large and round over your head.</p>Rock squeezes his massive hand around your neck, as it grows longer and fuzzier. You cough as he chokes and squeezes you, forcing himself deeper and deeper into your long fuzzy body. Archie, your fellow ermine, does the same, pushing himself as deep into you as he can. Then, with a roaring, panting moan from Rock, and a shuddering gasp from Archie, they both orgasm together. Hot, thick cum floods your mouth, and heat fills your ass.</p>You look up, your mouth still plugged, and see Roland straddle Rock's crotch, and point his erect cock down at you. You barely close your eyes, just in time to avoid the thick, hot ropes of cum that your fellow gang member blasts in dripping strands all over your face. Then your superiors slowly pull themselves out of you, and you are left dazed and dripping on the floor near the bench. \"Well done, new fish. You have joined the society of superiors. Winter forever!\", Rock growls. You giggle and shudder, and only manage to weakly say \"Yeah, yeah!\", before passing out.",

Archie whimpers and tries to scurry under the table, so you quickly grab him by the tail and shake him until he goes limp. He, too, is dropped and pinned under your foot.</p>Without his minions, Rock looks nervous. Seems the big bear is all talk. You look at the three of them, and decide which one you will become. You order Rock to strip naked, and he nods, before slowly pulling his shirt up over his fluffy belly, and dropping his pants. You then order him to get on all fours. As he drops down, you press your foot onto his muzzle and shove it firmly against the hard floor. \"Th-thank you mistress\", he whimpers.</p>You climb atop the furry polar bear's back, and recline on him like he is a throne. The other two exchange a nervous glance. You snap your fingers at Archie, and order him to crawl around your neck. He does so, a little confused, and you wrap him across your shoulders like a scarf. He goes limp, obediently. Finally, you turn to Roland, and command him to serve his mistress. You spread your legs, and the white fox climbs up to you, and presses his muzzle between them. His long face licks and kisses at your pussy, his tongue stroking the sensitive lips and then sliding inside as he eats you out.</p>You shiver with satisfaction, and then order the fox to lie on his back atop Rock, who is wriggling slightly from arousal. The fox reclines back, his erect cock in the air, and you lower yourself onto it as you start to ride him. He grunts and pants, as you push yourself up and down on his shaft, using him like a toy.</p>As you pleasure yourself with your new servants, your skin starts to tingle. White, soft fur grows down over your body, forming a smooth and luscious pelt. Your ears stretch up atop your head, pointed and fluffy, and your face lengthens and shifts. You feel your teeth grow sharper, and your senses heighten as your head becomes the white, elegant face of an arctic vixen. Your tailbone stretches behind you, growing thick and long as a large, fluffy brush tail forms on it. Your hands and feet stretch out into long, slender paws, and you moan with delight as you push yourself down on Roland's cock. You feel the smaller fox gasp and pant, as he starts to cum, his thick, hot cum rushing inside you.</p>Finally, you pull yourself off him, and make Archie crawl down your body to lick the fox's cum from your pussy. The nervous ermine does so very willingly. The three of them then bow to you, all panting and excited to serve their dominant queen.",

Your tip teases against his hole, and then you push firmly against his tight black donut. He's so large that you slide in easily, feeling his plush and soft rear all around your shaft. You start to pump and thrust into him, your balls slapping against his fat ass, and each thrust making him grunt and whimper with shame.</p>The other two watch their boss being dominated with nervous glances. You point at Archie, and order him to get over here and lick your feet. The little ermine does so immediately, crawling on all fours to get to your bare feet before rubbing and nuzzling his pointy, fluffy face against them. Roland gulps as you order him behind you, and tell him to start licking your ass. He looks reluctant, but he does so, and you feel his furry muzzle stroke against your rear before his long tongue laps over your hole and slips slightly inside.</p>The attention and pleasure from your minions is enough to get you pumping harder and faster. You start to grow, your belly first, as it bulges and swells, becoming round and heavy. Then, your body creaks and stretches, getting taller and wider. Your feet thicken, becoming massive and wide, as your soles become thick, black pads. Chunky claws emerge from your toes, and you pin Archie down under one of your massive paws, forcing him to sniff and lick them as they become heavy, furry white bear paws.</p>Your tailbone stretches slightly, becoming a small, furry tuft, but the change in your rear mostly happens in your ass, as it becomes enormous, wide and furry. Roland yelps as he is almost engulfed by your huge fluffy bear cheeks. Your fat belly is covered in the same thick, shaggy white fur, and you feel your face stretch out, becoming thick, wide and streamlined. Fur covers your head, leaving you white all over, except for your dark black nose. The pleasure of your huge strong body overwhelms you, and you grip Rock's ass in your two massive paws, as you roar and slam yourself into him. Your thick, shiny black cock pulses and thickens, before unloading massive ropes of hot, sticky cum into the emasculated bear's ass. You grunt and pant, filling him over and over, before you finally pull free.</p>Your toes wiggle over Archie as you grin and look down at your new minions. This body feels so powerful and arrogant and RIGHT. You can see why Rock acted like he did.",

                        "text": "As you approach the cages, you notice something odd. While many of the cages are filled by quadrupedal, snarling dogs, a few others have stranger inhabitants. A feral ram, a huge quadrupedal otter, and a snarling tiger. All of them are collared, and some have tattered scraps of...prisoner uniforms on them.</p>You feel a cold, dangerous presence behind you, and suddenly Vicious the warden is mere inches from your back. His hand strokes across your side as he walks around you, and looks you up and down curiously. \"Interested in my dogs? They, unlike people, are always obedient. Though they often do not start that way\", he says.</p>As he stares at you, he seems to come to a decision. His knife is suddenly in his hand, and he slices it down in front of you with incredible dexterity. You barely feel anything, but your shirt falls open as he cut the fabric cleanly in two. \"I have several dogs, but none of them are human. I wonder what a feral human will look like...\", he says.</p>You try to back away, but he lunges at you, and suddenly there is a heavy object around your neck, and...Master Vicious's face is right in front of you. His big, powerful eyes. His handsome body. Master Vicious is so strong and wise and powerful. You reach up and feel the heavy, strange collar around your neck. You realise, partly, that it is affecting your mind, but you are unwilling to remove it. Master Vicious gave it to you. You have to be good for Master Vicious.</p>Master tugs on the leash attached to your collar, and you fall down to all fours. He strokes your head, and says something to you. At first you sort of understand him, but then it just becomes muffled, strange sounds. Words are fading from your mind, along with complex concepts like reading and writing. Your brain feels slow, and sluggish, and simple. You follow along behind Master, walking on your knuckles and feet, as he leads you into a cage, and locks you in.</p>Over the course of days, Master trains you. You get food and water from bowls, like the other dogs. Sometimes Master doesn't leave out enough bowls, and you have to shove and fight to get yours. You get bruised and battered a lot, but over the days and weeks, your skin becomes toughier, and hairier, and you get better at it. Master approves when you fight hard and make the other dogs run and cower.</p>Master also takes you for walks, and makes you run and exercise a lot. Your knuckles hurt on the ground at first, but your hands get bigger and rougher, and you get better and better at your lumbering gait. Your soles and palms get rough and strong, and your arms and legs thicken with muscle.</p>Master trains you to follow commands, teaching you to roll over, sit, and stay. When you don't do it fast enough, he zaps you, and your big collar makes you hurt and ache all over. You soon learn to always do as Master says. Even when he brings prisoners, and makes you tackle and snarl and bite at them. At first you didn't want to do that, but a week with no food and regular thrashings taught you again to never disobey master.</p>Months later, and you are barely recognisable as human. Your hair is long, shaggy and dirty, and your skin is rough, calloused and hairy. You snarl and lumber like a beast, and your eyes are dull and stupid. You are nothing but an attack animal, trained to obey.",

You growl and bark at him, but he just grins at you. He says something that, though you don't understand it, you somehow know is incredibly smug. Then he flicks you in the nose and...suddenly you realise how ridiculous you look, naked on all fours. You reach up and slowly remove your collar. Mr Bat chuckles.</p>\"Puppy had a good time? What a cute doggy you are. Maybe next time I save you, I should get you to shake hands afterwards?\", he says. Instinctively, you growl at him, and he sniggers. He unlocks the gate to let you leave, and as he turns the corner, he seems to disappear.",

You are pushed out into the open air, and forced to line up along with all the other prisoners. The guards are more quiet and reserved than usual, with none of their usual joking or insulting comments.</p>You are forced to stand between Gon and a tall, scarred giraffe. You whisper up to the giraffe and ask what's going on, and he cranes his neck down to whisper back. \"Just stay quiet and don't look him in the eyes, new fish\", he grunts.</p>Finally, the doors open up, and Vicious walks in, before turning and standing to attention. Even the deranged dingo is taking this seriously. Emerging from the darkness behind him, and unfolding as he stands tall and straight in the open air, is an enormous, dark-feathered gryphon. His beak is thick and sharp, with a distinctive red marking on the top, and he is wearing a gold-trimmed black uniform. At full height, he stands taller than the door to the yard, and his gigantic black-furred lion paws are each bigger than most prisoner's chests. Vicious drops his salute, and you see him stare at the gryphon with a crazed, almost worshipful gaze. \"Stand to order! You are in the presence of his magnificence, Lord of the Iron Skies, Breaker of Horns, the first Emperor of the Republic of Horn! Emperor Drum!\", Vicious shouts. The other prisoners salute, and you quickly follow suit.</p>Drum crosses his arms, and looks down at you all with a cold and steely glare. \"Prisoners. You have each been sent here because you have wronged, and you have sinned. Many of you hurt others, and others were a danger to society\", Drum says. His voice is deep, and powerful. It resonates inside your head and makes you stand stiffer, your salute becoming more straight and firm.</p>\"Fear not. There is a place in this world even for you. At this prison, we will reform you. We will teach you to contribute to society. The work you do here will service the people below, and you will atone for your crimes. For all of this is, is for the glory of Horn\", he says. His words make you feel warm and proud inside. Together, in perfect unison, all of you shout \"For the Glory of Horn!\"</p>You can tell that something is happening to you. You have felt this kind of power before. It's similar to what you felt when you met Leonar, but where his presence made you want to love and service him, Drum seems to make you want to be dutiful, and loyal, and serve society. He turns, and Vicious walks behind him as he continues his tour of the prison. It takes several minutes before the warmth and energy of his voice fades from you, and you still feel a strange resonance for the rest of the day when you think of him.",

                        "text": "You walk down to the kennels, feeling strange as you do. You keep fantasising about Vicious having another victim ready for you. You imagine cutting and slicing someone up as you lick their wounds, or tying them up and beating them to feel their flesh against your knuckles. Other prisoners move out of your way, and even the guards eye you with concern. When you get to the kennels, you see that Vicious is standing on the roof, looking out through one of the narrow slit-windows at the side of the fortified prison walls.</p>You climb up with your bare hands, pulling yourself up onto the straw-thatched roof of the kennel. Vicious turns to look at you, and beckons you over. He shoves you against the wall, hard, and you growl with pleasure at the feeling. \"Look out there\", he commands. You take a look, and see that from this window you can distantly see out past the cliff, to the dark, snow-dusted town below. \"That is Horn, my home town\", he says. You feel something around your neck, and reach up to feel a rough hempen rope. Before you can react, Vicious suddenly kicks you, and you are thrown off the roof, to the kennel below. The rope snaps taut, and suddenly constricts around your neck. You are left dangling and choking, your throat burning, and your neck aching as it squeezes tighter and tighter.</p>Vicious hops down from the roof and lands gracefully next to you. He begins to pull your pants down, avoiding your thrashing and kicking legs. He then slides a knife calmly up your chest, slicing off your shirt even as your writhing becomes more desperate, your lungs aflame with need.</p>\"I grew up down there, you know. One of many orphan cubs. I assume if I had a family, they were caught in the fighting during the revolution. It was odd, though. There were tons of us, back then\", he says. He pulls on you, tightening the rope around your neck, his grin stretching as you pant and choke on it. \"The others would cry, sometimes. But I never did. I didn't understand why anyone would. If someone weaker than me had something I wanted, I'd just take it. Even if it killed the person I was taking from. Most of them wouldn't do that. If they did, they acted...sick? They said it was 'guilt', but I thought they were just making things up. It took me a long time to realise I wasn't like them. I didn't feel the things they felt\", he says. Your vision is darkening at the edges, and everything is turning grey. Just as your body begins to numb, he suddenly slashes, cutting the rope.</p>You pant, and gasp, as you land hard on the dirt floor. Your neck is absolute agony and every breath is like knives. It's turning you on like crazy. You look up and grin madly as you lunge forward and shove him against the wall. You slide his knife from his sheath, and start to trace it up his chest. He shudders with anticipation, and you press down harder, cutting the skin and leaving a red, dripping trail up his body. He snarls with delight. \"I thought I was broken. Then, one day, the guards caught me, after I killed this old man for the shillings in his purse. They were going to execute me, but Emperor Drum was passing by. He took me in, he understood me. He said I wasn't broken. I was special. He honed my skills, and told me that in hard times, he needed men like me, who could do terrible things, for the greater good\", he says. He takes your wrist, and presses the knife against his neck, before leaning it and kissing you. His teeth bite down on your tongue hard enough to draw blood, and it makes your kiss tastes like iron filings. He leans back and looks at you with mad obsession.</p>\"I thought I was the only one. But you're just like me\", he says. Your fingers slide around his neck, knocking the knife aside and you start to squeeze. He kisses you harder as you choke him, and you feel his neck muscles grow taut, his breath grow ragged. He opens his mouth, and pulls you close, but instead of kissing you, his muzzle closes around your neck as he bites you. His teeth sink into your flesh, and you pant and shove him, feeling overwhelmed with violent, insane lust.</p>Your fingers around his neck start to shift, growing thicker and rougher. Dark pads form on your palms, and thick black claws grow from your fingertips and draw blood from your lover's neck. His jaw tightens around your neck, and you snarl as you throw him aside. He rolls along the ground, and lunges at you, claws outstretched. His fingers slice across your chest, even as you feel your muscles grow and harden, and black fur begin to spread over you. As it grows, your blood soaks into it, making it feel like the blood itself is mixing with your new pelt as it covers your body. You grab Vicious's wrists, and feel your face stretch and grow. Your jaw crack and stretch, your teeth become sharp and cruel. Your ears stretch up tall atop your head, as you pant and growl, looking down between your eyes to see the long, powerful jaw of a doberman. You know just how to use it.</p>Your teeth snap over vicious's muzzle, as you bite down hard on him, forcing his jaw closed and tearing and ripping at his face. His blood is delicious. You can feel your new tail, thin and black and furry, starting to grow and wag from the joy of combat, of blood. His hands slash at your eyes, and you release him, backing off slightly. You realise you are taller now, your feet growing thicker and stronger as they shift and change into huge, powerful canine paws. You look down at your body, the black and brown fur covering your lithe, deadly form. Every powerful muscle designed to fight, every part of you the perfect combat dog. Vicious is staring at you, unblinking, his blood soaking his face even as it drips from your jaw. \"If I can love anything at all, I think I might love you. Be mine\", he pants.</p>You answer by throwing his own knife right at his heart. He catches it, the blade sinking into his fingers and making more blood drip down his wrist. He shudders. \"I take that as a yes\", he says.</p>Hours later, by the time you finally finish your fight, you can't tell how much of the fluid soaking each of your chests is blood, and how much is cum.",
