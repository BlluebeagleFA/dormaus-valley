Then you need to mess up a few times. Not enough to be suspicious, but enough to get pieces and fragments you can use in your key without arousing suspicion. Fortunately for you, the guard shoves you down with the mugs without even asking, and you are seated next to Clumsy Pete. Pete the hedgehog was caught burgling houses - because he kept bumping into everything and making too much noise. When he drops his new cups, fumbles his tools, and makes a mess of everything, the guard just sighs. You manage to make your quota of mugs without ever having to break any of your own, just by \"helping\" Pete gather up the bits and pieces he scatters everywhere and keeping some for yourself.</p>You wait until the guard gets fed up and starts reprimanding the unfortunate hedgehog, and then slip your stolen materials into the smelting pot. You watch nervously as they slowly glow, heat up, and become liquid, when the guard could turn around at any moment. Finally, it's ready, and you pour the glowing pewter onto your soap, hoping desperately it will hold its shape. Fortunately, Hornloft's terrible taste in rock-hard soap pays off, and you now have a fragile, but usable, key. Even better, no one will suspect you when they check the pewter used up against the amount of mugs collected.</p>Your plan is nearly complete. Now you just need to make sure you won't die from exposure atop the mountain as soon as you escape.",

You wonder if anyone in Horn knows other colours besides that. Your job is just to hammer out the dents and scratches, and sometimes to clean out dried blood too. Judging by how much damage these plates have, the Horn army must be quite busy.</p>The only thing of interest is when another black breastplate is handed to you, and as you start scrubbing it you notice it is different from the others. The black isn't from the dull black metal that the gryphon soldiers use, its ash. This one must have been dropped in with the others by mistake. You scrub harder, slowly revealing shiny smooth metal, with golden highlights on the edges. At the center of the armor is a painted emblem, warped from damage but still visible. It's a painted golden unicorn.</p>The guard notices you pausing, and walks over. When he sees what you are holding, he hisses in surprise, and grabs the armor from your grip.

Some positions are given out to specific prisoners as punishments or rewards, and others require volunteers. Finally, when it comes time to send someone to clean the warden's office, he sighs and asks for volunteers. You can clearly see from his dour expression that he's expecting none, and to have to make a grim decision about who to send. Until you raise your arm.</p>The other prisoners back off, like you must be insane. The guard looks more so. \"Are you...sure?\", he says. You nod, and he just stares blankly for a while before pointing you over to Vicious's office. You walk down the long corridor, and slowly push open the engraved wooden door to his room. He's standing behind his desk, staring at some sort of diagram on the wall. You get on your knees and start scrubbing the stone floor. After a while, he walks around, and you feel his huge leather boot press down on your back. You continue to look down at the floor, able to faintly see the reflection of his unreadable, mad eyes looking down at you. His black baton moves down to press uncomfortably against the back of your head. \"I hear that you volunteered for duty here, criminal\", he says. He twists the baton, and his weight on your back grows heavier. \"Did you think I would be grateful for your obedience? Pleased that you want to serve me?\", he says. He shoves his foot forward, and you are sent sprawling onto the floor. \"Get up. Get against the wall, scum\", he snarls.</p>You stand up and back away towards the wall, then feel his body press hard against yours. His breath is hot against the back of your neck, and his hands stroke across your back for a moment, before suddenly ripping your shirt open. He pulls your arms up over your head, and you feel him fastening heavy shackles around your wrists. He steps back, and pulls on something, and you feel yourself being hoisted up into the air, lifted by ropes attached to the shackles. You dangle helplessly, and slowly spin on your bindings.</p>As you spin, you are turned around and see Vicious sitting on his desk, staring at you. He is grinning, and holding a long, thick black cord that is coiled into a loop. You turn more, back to the wall this time, and there is a sudden, explosive lash of pain across your back. You yelp and struggle as the agony strikes your exposed skin, along with the snapping CRACK of a whip. When you spin around back the other way, you see that the cord was a long bullwhip dangling from Vicious's grip. In his other hand, he has pulled his cock out from his black pants, and is slowly stroking it.</p>You wriggle and tug on your cuffs, but you are totally at the dingo's mercy. Every time your back turns to him, he strikes out with his whip, sending cruel lash after lash across your skin, leaving shining stinging red lines across your back. The force of it keeps you spinning, and he gets more excited and aroused with every strike, pumping his cock faster and faster. Finally, after what feels like an eternity of torture, and with your entire back a red raw canvas of pain, he howls and snarls, his cock erupting with thick white cum that splatters all over his desk, and down the floor onto his boots. </p>He sighs and stretches, smiling as he watches you dangle, then eventually stands and unties the rope that is holding you up. You fall to the floor with a thump, and he steps over to release your cuffs. You slowly push yourself up onto your arms and knees, and see his leather boots in front of you, still dripping with cum.</p>\"Lick them clean, criminal. It's what you came here for\", he commands. Not wanting to annoy him further, you comply. Your tongue slides across the polished, bitter surface of his shiny boots, as you lap up the warm salty cum and leave them shining. Once you are done, he gives you a dismissive kick that digs into your chest and sends you tumbling, before returning to his desk. \"Leave. If you come here again, I will kill you\", he says matter-of-factly. You quickly make your exit.",

His legs and arms are tightly bound in rope, which is attached to a hook on the rafters. He whimpers and moans through a bundle of rags gagging his mouth, and his crotch gleams from a shiny metal chastity cage that has sealed his cock away. Vicious is sitting on his desk, looking bored as he cracks the whip again. It slashes against the lizard's smooth green rump, leaving a pink line and making him arch his back and scream through his gag.</p>Vicious looks at you, and though a mirthless grin stretches across the dingo's face, his eyes remain just as cold and unreadable as ever. \"Good. You came. I wouldn't have liked having to spend time out of my day executing you\", he says. He hops to his feet, and walks over to the lizard, who whines pathetically. His hand strokes across the lizard's naked underside, and the lizard looks over to you with a desperate, helpless expression.</p>Vicious then reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a clunky, cumbersome baton. He squeezes it, and lightning arcs across the pins on the tip. He rams it firmly into the lizard's exposed, swollen balls, and the lizardman arches his back, screaming through his gag as his eyes open wide and he shakes in pain. Vicious pulls the tazer away, and the lizard coughs and gags, shaking and terrified.</p>Then, Vicious turns to you, and hands you the baton. He looks at you, expectantly.",

The only thing cooking seems to be a massive pot of soup, bubbling gently on the stove. You are suddenly pushed aside from behind by someone, and you turn to see a tall, fat gryphon guard walking past you. He looks at you curiously. \"You new? Don't recognise you. Doesn't matter. Help me get ready\", he orders. He hops up onto the countertop, and lifts his feet. His huge, heavy black boots are pointed right at you, and you blink in confusion. He stares at you disdainfully. \"Well? Take them off!\", he growls.</p>You obey, still confused. You grip onto the bottom of his boots with both hands, and begin to slowly tug on them. They slide gradually off his foot, getting easier to pull the more you drag them off, but also filling the room with a musky, sweaty stench of footpaws. Finally, you pull the boot off completely, and come face to face with the hot, glistening sole of the gryphon's foot. Sweat is dripping slowly down his lion-like paw, and along the thick, full brown pad that covers the bottom of his black-furred foot. The smell is overwhelming. It makes your knees weak, and you can see the air steaming over his paw. It makes you want to obey him, want to submit to his superiority and accept anything he says. To proclaim gryphons as the superior species and live under their feet forever. You are snapped out of your fantasies when he snaps his fingers in front of you. \"Hey! Prisoner! Keep it together, you have a job to do. Other boot, now\", he says.</p>You nod, and slowly start to pull his other boot free, your mouth watering at the thought of the sexy, perfect footpaw hidden within. This time, when you pull it off, you find yourself shoving your face into his boot, and deeply inhaling the steamy, swampy stench that flows from within. He sighs. \"Emperor's beard, get a grip on yourself. Come on, there's work to do\", he says. He moves over to the pot, and rests his feet over the top of it, letting his sweat drip into the bubbling stew. He orders you to pour his boots over the food, and you obey eagerly. You upend his boots, and watch a trickle of stinking, musky sweat pour out over your fellow prisoner's food.</p>\"There we go. Keeps you lot more obedient, easier to keep underfoot. Rub my feet and get every last drop in there\", he commands. You are only too happy to comply, and you take his paws and start to squeeze and rub your fingers over his thick, smooth pads. Sweat soaks your skin and drips down into the food, and your heart pounds with love and obedience. Gryphons are perfect. They are wonderful. You will do anything they say! The guard grins as he watches you, and reaches his foot over to stroke it along your face. \"I've never seen someone as susceptible to this as you, prisoner. Damn, I need to make a request to keep you as a personal doormat. Here, I'll give you a reward - you can kiss the floor where my footsteps are\", he says, stifling a laugh. You nod eagerly, the sound of that seeming like an amazing gift. He hops down and grabs his boots, then walks barefoot out of the kitchen. As promised, you fall to all fours and kiss and lick the floor where he stepped, drunk with adoration for your gryphon masters.</p>By the time the hypnotic fugue in your head clears, the other prisoners have come to get the stew. One rat looks down at you with disgust. \"Have some fucking self-respect\", he says to you. You sit up, embarrassed, and try to get the thought of gryphon feet out of your head.",

The gryphon guard jabs him with the butt of his spear, and the rabbit struggles against the ropes binding his arms as he spits at him. \"Fuck you, pig!\", he growls. The gryphon wipes the spit from his face and shoves the rabbit forward. \"Cut Rabbit, after consistent bad behaviour, it has been decided you will best serve society by becoming food. You, prisoner, turn this criminal into stew. Don't worry, our process is humane and painless\", the gryphon says.</p>With the rabbit struggling and kicking the entire time, the guard helps you lift him up and place him in the deep pot. The white rabbit, Cut, looks up at you with unrestrained rage. \"I hope I give you food poisoning, asshole\", he growls. He then shudders and pants, his eyes closing as you feel warmth begin to flow up from the pot. Not painful warmth, but instead a strangely relaxing, deep warmth like from an intense massage. Cut sits down, panting and sweating heavily, and spreads his legs. You see his sheath start to plump up and swell, as his cock emerges from its fuzzy home and bulges out as it grows erect. You look for the recipe book, still feeling weird about this situation, and find only what looks like...crudely drawn pornography? The recipe seems to just be drawings of a rabbit in a pot, being masturbated and massaged.</p>Well, orders are orders. You lean over atop the pot, and reach down towards Cut's shaft. He snarls at you, but doesn't struggle when you grip his thick, hard length and begin to stroke it. He bucks his hips against you, cursing and panting, and you see thick, creamy pre start to leak and gush rapidly from his shaft. It oozes over your hand in a constant, messy flow, getting thicker and faster the more you stroke him. \"Oh fuck, that feels good. Did you get sent here for bein' a whore, bitch?\", he says with a grin. You squeeze his cock much harder, but he seems to enjoy the rough treatment. More strange, thick pre gushes and splashes out from his dick, rapidly creating a pool at the bottom of the pot. It smells rich, and pleasant, and delicious.</p>Cut starts to shift and wriggle, and he leans back in the pot, as he pushes his long furry white feet up towards you, with his back resting in the goopy precum. He wiggles his toes and grins at you. You grip one of his long paws and start to rub and squeeze it, feeling his fur warm and soaked with goopy, creamy fluid. As you rub and massage it, it seems to get softer, and much wetter, with thick white cream dripping freely down his leg. You squeeze harder, and your fingers actually go THROUGH Cut's paw, squishing into it like his foot is made of jelly. You squish and ooze his foot between your fingers, as it melts and sloshes, becoming creamy stew and falling into the pot. He doesn't seem to notice, because his eyes are clenched shut, and you see his cock is now erupting with an endless flow of thick, hot stew. It spurts and splatters over his face, against the sides of the pot, and everywhere it can, in an endless, incredible orgasm.</p>You reach down and push Cut down, his body sinking into the creamy warm stew all around him. You stroke and rub his chest as it becomes wet, and squishy, and slowly melts into cream. Finally, you rub his cheeks, and watch as his orgasmic, blissful face slowly relaxes and sinks into the bubbling, delicious-smelling stew.</p>As you look at the now-full pot of hot cream stew, you wonder if Cut is still aware inside it. Soon, the guard returns to take the pot and drag it off to the canteen. It might just be your imagination, but you could swear you hear a faint, bubbling \"fuck you pig\" as he pulls it away.",

The cue ball bounces against a red one, sending it forward with vicious speed right into the fox's sack. His screams of pain make Vicious visibly shiver with glee.</p>\"Now, what can I help you with, pup?\", He asks. You tell him that you are looking for some of his socks, and he jabs his pool cue towards you, stopping a hair's breadth from your neck.

I am sure I can arrange that\", he says.</p>He walks to his desk and sits down, before raising his feet and wiggling one boot at you. You growl, your heart beginning to race, and drop to all fours. You crawl over to him and nuzzle against his leather boot, smelling the polished, creaking material. He raises it and shoves hard against your face with the sole, crunching against you in a kick that sends pain rushing up through your face and makes your nose bleed.</p>Your instincts flare up, and you tackle your master, knocking him off his chair and causing him to crack his head against his desk. He grins widely, a thin line of red on the side of his face starting to drip. You slam him down and pin one of your feet against his neck, while you bite on his boot and pull it off roughly. The thick, masculine scent of your master's paw oozes from the freed boot as his wet, warm socked paw is revealed. It makes you dizzy, and your tail starts to wag, moments before he kicks and claws at you. His dingo claws rip through the fabric and score across your chin, slicing gashes into your fur. You snarl and open your jaws, before biting down hard on his leg, then ripping his sock off with one of your hands.</p>Your foot suddenly slips and slams against the ground, as he slides out from under you and jabs his knee into your chest. You recoil, giving him a moment to slip around and grab the sock in your mouth with both hands, before yanking back with it and pulling it tight against your mouth. He ties it closed, leaving you gagged with his salty paw taste in your muzzle. His arms wrap around you from behind as he strokes and teases his fingers across your chest. \"How very charming you look like that, my pet. Perhaps one of these days I should tie you up and keep you under my desk as a footrest...\", he croons. He lifts his arm and turns your head towards him, before slowly licking at the warm blood trickling from your nose. \"Another time, however. I do have actual work to do at some point today\", he says. He pats your head and sends you on your way.",
