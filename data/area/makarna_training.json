First you run laps around the training yard, including over obstacles like wooden rings and hurdles. Your legs ache and you stumble several times, but the lions catch you and guide you through, urging you to go on.</p>Next, you climb hand-over-hand across bars set up over a mud pit, and climb up over a tall wooden wall. Your arms are soon aching too, and you end up last out of all of the recruits, most of whom have clearly run this course countless times.</p>Finally, there is a sparring session. You are tossed a long wooden staff, and instructed on making basic parries and deflections in what they call \"Wood Stance\", a sort of martial art. It takes you a little while to get the hang of it, but by the end of training you are consistently blocking the kicks and strikes of your sparring partner.</p>At the end of it, you are congratulated on your hard work by the lions. They surround you, patting your shoulder and back and giving you congratulatory hugs. Being pressed so close to their musky, sweaty naked bodies is a little dizzying. Finally, they walk away, but only after each of them runs their fingers through your hair, a feeling that makes you shudder oddly. Is your hair a little longer than it was before?</p>",

Several of them repeat the gesture from last time, where they run their fingers through your hair and call you \"new recruit\". You have to remind them several times that you're not actually joining the Makarnan army, but they just grin and don't reply.</p>The salute and anthem don't start when you expect. The lions are all staring at you, and one of them taps his bare chest. You realise what they are expecting, and begrudgingly you remove your clothes and place them aside, so that you are naked like the others.</p>They all salute, and you copy them, thumping your hand against your chest and holding it in a fist. You mumble through the anthem, still not knowing the words, but you put in a good effort and they seem to appreciate it. The pride of your fellow soldiers makes your heart pound, and you grin with pleasure at their approval.</p>You start running the same laps from last time. At first it feels awkward doing it barefoot, but you find that somehow you are going much faster than before. You seem to easily and dextrously step across the hoops, and you leap over the hurdles with glee. The other lions let out roars of support, and keep tapping or slapping your back as you pass eachother. You are so excited with how much you've improved, you barely register at all that there is golden fluff forming on your legs, or that your muscles are bulging more than they should.</p>You finish the laps, and bounce eagerly as you wait for the next part. Your toes flex on the ground, the hot Makarnan soil no longer feeling uncomfortable, as pink pawpads form on your soles, and slits form on your toes for your retractable claws. Your hair feels longer and thicker, waving in the wind.</p>Next comes the climbing bars. Your muscles burn and ache, but the feeling just makes you growl and go even faster. Golden fur spreads along your arms, and your claws dig into the wood as you rush forward. You pounce forward onto the wooden wall, the claws from your fingers and toes extending as they dig into the wood, and you start to climb up. You feel so dextrous, so powerful! Your muscles bulge, the golden fur spreading across your body, and a tufted tail forms behind you and flicks in the air.</p>You leap from the top of the wall, landing on all fours, and then jump up to your feet and roar with excitement. You were in the top three fastest! The other lions grab you, congratulating you and ruffling your mane. You purr a little, overwhelmed by their friendliness and praise.</p>Next comes the sparring session. This time you remember a lot of the basics of the stance, and you take to it quite quickly. You block your partner's kicks and strikes, and with each blow, you feel a little stronger, a little more comfortable in the Makarnan heat. Your whiskers twitch as they grow out from your face, and your body feels natural, like this exertion and these moves are made for you.</p>Finally, you finish up, panting and sweating. Your fellow lions open their arms wide, and you pounce forward for congratulatory hugs and head rubs. Their scent feels welcoming and warm. Your brothers in arms. Your fellow soldiers. You forget everything but the feeling of their bodies, and then you leave, dizzy and happy.</p>It takes you quite a while to realise something is up - you find yourself walking \"home\" through the Makarnan streets like you've lived here your whole life. You look down at your muscular, agile lion body, and realise you left all your clothes at the barracks! You return quietly, fetching your stuff, and think it might be safer if you don't show up for a third session...</p>",

You manage to resist the urge to return to training, though you find yourself walking closer and closer to the grounds, listening to them doing drills, smelling the scent of their hard-working bodies.</p>You think you are resisting it well...until you find yourself idly walking one day just a street away from the training ground. Your paws ache, your legs tense. You want to run in, to train, to be one with your brothers in arms.</p>Then you hear that familiar thump, of all your fellow soldiers hitting their fists to their chests in the Makarnan salute. Unconsciously, you realise you did it too. The words to the Makarnan anthem echo in your head, and you start to run towards the training ground. Your fur feels hot, and you strip off your clothes, throwing them aside without a care. You fall to all fours for better speed, as you rush into the barracks, and pounce into your place in line.</p>You stand up, your eyes glowing with pride and excitement, as you bellow out the last lines of the anthem together, in perfect harmony with your fellow soldiers.</p>\"The dragons are our makers,</p>This bond will never sever.</p>Let all who hear us quake;</p>Makarna lasts forever!\"</p>As you roar out the words, your whole body feels hot and intense. Your mind surges with pleasure and happiness, as an overwhelming feeling of belonging and pride washes away all other thoughts and desires.</p>You take to training today with great glee. Your padded golden paws are perfect for running laps in the desert heat, and you leap over the hurdles with feline grace. Your powerful arms carry you along the climbing bars, and your strong claws dig into the wooden wall as you climb it like a natural feline.</p>When you spar, you throw your entire body and focus into it. The Makarnan martial arts feel perfectly natural to you now, like you've been training with these your entire life. You wrestle naked with your fellow soldiers, and practice your kicks and blows until your whole body is aching and sore.</p>You even watch with envy as the most advanced warriors demonstrate the Four Material Stances, the greatest techniques of a Makarnan warrior. A master of the Wood stance takes a defensive posture, his fur crackling as his skin transforms into thick bark. A master of Water stance pounces, becoming a glistening torrent of water in the air before reforming on the ground. The Fire stance master immolates himself with a mighty roar, his fur transforming into scorching flames. Finally, a master of Wind stance demonstrates a mighty kick that splits a granite block in half, as a devastating lightning bolt strikes alongside him.</p>You remember admiring the stance masters as a lion cub, craving the day when you would unlock your own personal elemental stance. Maybe even one of the rare and mysterious time-based stances! You are so overcome with excitement and fantasy that you don't quite realise that your memories of once being a lion cub and growing up on the streets of Makarna are entirely new.</p>With training complete, you stretch your muscles and return to the barracks with your fellow warriors in training. This is where you've lived for years now, after all, ever since you joined the army as a full time recruit. You hop onto your bunk, mind filled with thoughts of glory in battle, and protecting your homeland alongside your fellow recruits.</p>The drill sergeant, a large scarred lion, watches you with amusement. \"Settling in well, recruit?\", he calls over to you.</p>You blink, slightly confused. Settling in? You've been here for years, you explain to him. He nods, and scratches his beard.</p>\"Ah yeah, mistook you for someone else, a foreigner that was training with us recently.\"</p>You growl, and flick your tail with annoyance. You, a foreigner? You are a proud and loyal lion of Makarna! The drill master is probably just testing you again. Yes, you always have been a lion, and you always will be.</p>You settle down to sleep, surrounded by the gentle snores and feline musk of the other warriors just like you.",

Yes sir!\"</p>You strip down, pulling off your bronze bracers at your wrists and ankles, and pulling away your loincloth before sitting down on the stool obediently. The sergeant does the same, unbuckling the armour around his waist, and unwrapping the warm, well-worn lioncloth around his powerful furry golden crotch. It flops in his hands, a thick and damp white cloth, and he reaches forward and begins to wrap it around your muzzle.</p>\"Breathe in\", he orders. You do so, inhaling slowly and deeply. The sergeant's scent is heady and powerful, a thick beastly musk that makes you feel dizzy and warm.</p>\"Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out.\"</p>With each command, you inhale his powerful scent, and blow it back out into the loincloth. Your fur tingles, your body gets hotter, and you feel yourself getting erect. Your heavy lion shaft bulges and rises up, and you reach down to touch it, before he grabs your wrist and shakes his head.</p>\"You will not touch unless I order you to. You will obey my every command. You are a loyal soldier. Anything I tell you is fact. You do not need to think. You only need to obey.\"</p>\"Sir, yes sir...\", you mumble through the cloth.

You want to fight, to obey, to lead your country into glorious triumph. Your eyes glow with hypnotic pride.</p>\"You will discard all other loyalties. Only Makarna matters. You are a Makarnan soldier! You obey, and you fight!\"</p>\"SIR YES SIR!\"</p>He strokes his hand along your shaft, making your whiskers twitch as you gasp with need. Then he steps back, and crosses his arms.</p>\"Cum, soldier! Cum for your country, and worship only the Makarnan way!\"</p>Your words are tangled up, becoming a roar of pleasure as your entire body becomes awash with heat and need. Your cock, without even being touched, throbs and pulses, then erupts with thick, hot ropes of cum that splatter all over your bare chest, dripping from your fur and running down your muscular abs.</p>You pant, dizzy and happy, confused and barely remembering what just happened.</p>\"Tell me soldier, where did you grow up?\"</p>\"T...temple street, sir...\", you mutter quickly. You remember being a young lion there, helping with your parents business, going to the temples every week for devotions, working hard to prove yourself and join the military. You shudder with pleasure at the memories.</p>\"That's right. You've never left this glorious country. Why would you? You belong here, fighting for your king.\"</p>You nod, grinning and excited. You want to fight! To prove yourself!</p>\"Go wash off, private. We have more training very soon. Dismissed!\"</p>You stand and quickly gather your things, before heading out to the baths.

When your sergeant opens the door to the training yard, you are the first out, hopping on your feet and punching the air with excitement.</p>You and your squad strip naked, your golden-furred bodies shining in the harsh heat. The sergeant then takes you through your stretches, and you glance over at the other soldiers, seeing their muscles bulge, their perfectly toned bodies moving and flexing before you. Your heart beats faster, your mind idly running with thoughts of loyalty and pride. The scent and sight of your brothers in arms reinforces and constantly drums into you how perfect it is to be a lion, how you would never want to be anything else.</p>After stretches, you follow along with the fundamental steps of each of the Makarnan martial arts, your body aching as you pounce and spin with Fire Stance, defend with Wood Stance, and deliver boneshattering kicks with Thunder Stance. </p>You get matched up for one-on-one sparring with another soldier, and he grins at you as he takes a battle stance. \"Hey, how about this? First pin gets to pin the other tonight, if you get my drift\", he purrs. You growl back, excited and eager. \"You're on\", you respond in an identical feline purr.</p>You both circle eachother, striking out, dodging moves, judging eachother's defenses. He goes in for a full attack first, lunging towards your chest, but you duck out of the way and land a few body blows. He recovers, and duck under one of your punches, then kicks and strikes at you, winding you for a moment.</p>He runs in for a tackle and pin, but you push back, catching him and wrestling him to the ground. The two of you punch and roll, struggling for dominance, until you end up on top. He's grinning and panting under you, his face and chest bruised, but his eyes excited. \"Deal's a deal\", he says.</p>Later that night, he slips into your bunk, his naked body shining slightly in the dim candlelight. His breath huffs on your crotch as his muzzle strokes along your thighs, and his thick wet tongue finds your shaft. He sucks and pleasures you, purring and rumbling, until you are throbbing and dripping with need.</p>You wrap your arms around him, pressing him under you, and he lifts his tail. Your thick lion meat slams into him as you mount him, thrusting and grunting and growling. He pants, stroking himself as you thrust harder and faster. Your body shudders with delight, and you ram extra hard into him right as you unload your hot, thick feline seed deep inside him. He growls, gasping and drooling, as his own cock covers his chest in dripping cum.</p>He lies together with you that night, both your bodies pressed close, warm and furry and wonderful. His voice whispers in your ear as you fall asleep. You are a lion. You have always been a lion. You will never be anything else. You are a loyal, proud, hot Makarnan lion...",

A line of other recruits are standing awkwardly behind the sergeant, who composes himself and starts to snarl at the recruit. \"With ferocity! Crouch over more. More than that! Now always be moving - no, not like that, you're going to-\", he says, before being interrupted as the recruit trips over his own paws and lands awkwardly on the sandy courtyard. The sergeant sighs, and sees you watching. \"Ho there, traveller. Trying to get these greenpaws to do some anti-tiger drills, but fighting against wooden dummies is no way to get to grips with how a tiger warrior moves. Though they are probably better than training against this fool!\" he growls. The clumsy recruit looks away with embarrassment, and the grizzled sergeant rubs his chin as he looks you up and down. \"Tell you what, son, I learned a few spells on my deployments. You let me turn you into a tiger, and you can train with us. My rookies get a real tiger to face off against, and you get free training from the mightiest army in the seven kingdoms!

He rubs his hands together and takes a wide stance. \"Right, let me see if I remember how to do this properly. Don't give me that look, don't you know all felines are gifted with magic? Of course I can do this!\" he says. Your skepticism only grows when he starts to stumble over his words, and wave his arms in a very unconvincing manner. It seems to have done something though - you can feel the now-familiar tingle of magic as it crawls over your skin and wraps around you like invisible tendrils. You look down at your arms, and see the colour slowly changing, becoming a deep burnished orange, and then developing darker tiger stripes. A promising start, if not for one thing - there's no fur growing, only a shiny smooth texture that squeaks when you move your arms, and gleams very unnaturally. You watch the rubbery texture spread along your upper arms, forming plastic wrinkles and bends at your elbows. It also spreads down your hands, and your fingertips bulge out into puffy, cartoonish digits, before you grow stubby and blunt rubbery claws.</p></p>You try to warn the sergeant that his spell isn't working properly, but your voice comes out as a loud and high-pitched squeak. The pressure of your squeak seems to push at your face, causing it to bulge out and inflate. You feel a forced grin stretch on your growing squeaky rubber muzzle, while your vision blurs for a moment, before your eyes become painted-on colours on your smooth, rubbery head. You open your mouth and touch your rubber tongue and blunt artificial teeth, while the rubber spreads down your chest and legs. Your feet bulge out into puffy rubber paws, and a long shiny striped rubber tiger tail stretches from your rear and sways in the breeze. Your final change is the most embarrassing, as the rubber flows...</p></p>With your entire body now covered in tiger-print rubber, you feel your insides grow light and strange. A great hole seems to form inside you, replacing your organs and bones with nothing but inflated air. The sensation is very odd, as you discover that even the most cautious of steps is at risk of leaving you bouncing off the ground and through the air. The captain gives you a pained expression as he takes in your artificial, fake-tiger appearance. \"Well...that's closer than the rookie's impression I suppose. Are you sure you were thinking tigery thoughts?\" he says. You say something cutting, but you're still struggling with your squeaky-toy throat, and it mostly comes out as vaguely offensive squeaks.</p></p>Although you did agree to help the guards with their training, the futility of attempting to do so is quite clear the first time one of them baps you with a polearm and you immediately bounce across the courtyard. It's dizzying, but not painful. The guard's hopeful expression is dashed when the sergeant assures him that real tigers aren't actually that easy to knock away. Eventually, they give up, and the sergeant says he'll just do it himself. His terrifying roars and attacks are quite believable as a relentless tiger. You wonder if he missed his calling as an actor. Unfortunately, he's so occupied with his impression that he doesn't turn you back, and you end up leaving the training yard on your new inflatable rubber paws.",
