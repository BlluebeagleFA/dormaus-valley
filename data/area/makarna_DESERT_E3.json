You try to cover yourself like you would have you a blanket, yet your hands lay numb and unmoving. As memories of your recent ambush, panic filled your heart making you struggle only to find that you had been stripped of all your belongings and that you were bound to a slab of metal, its cold sting making apparent its make.</p>You try to take stock of the situation looking around frantically looking for an escape. Above you a bright golden light like a spotlight shone upon your bound figure, making apparent your meager package and making you blush. Trying not to get hard you try to crane your head to your sides. On either side you are surrounded by hooded figures whose faces are obscured yet had their black muzzles peeking out barely visible. </p>They continued to chant in unintelligible words that seemed to draw power of some sort. As they went on with their chanting the spotlight above you began to shine brighter and cover the entire room, revealing enough gold to buy out a small country. Gold lined everything from various glyphs on the wall, to the intricate lines adorning the sandstone floors.</p>One of the hooded figures raises their paw, and everything went silent. He pulled back his hood revealing a face reminiscent of canine but blacker, sleeker, somehow more elegant yet at the same time feral. Not being given enough time to admire his face he opened his mouth and began to spoke in their tongue, then later in a language you could understand.</p>“Welcome brothers! Today we celebrate, for the sacred vessel has finally arrived” with a flourish of his hand something small and golden appeared in his hand, the glaring light glinting of its gilded surface making it hard for you to make out what it is.</p>“Long have we waited for this sacred day, I have been head priest for as long as I can remember, waiting for the day we can finally bring our master to this world, and today is the day” he then began to move towards where you were bound, his clawed finger gingerly tracing lines all along your body, pleasure rippling all over your entire body as lines of gold were left where his fingers had gone, faintly visible.</p>Warmth began to spread along your body and your member began to harden, and all who were in the room began to gawk at your member, meager as it was.</p>With your face reddening in shame, surprise became apparent on your face as you felt the same clawed hand running along your body moments ago slowly stroking your half-hard member into full-mast. It barely filled his palm, yet he went on, stroking at varying speeds edging you until you felt the need to hump into his paw to try and get off.</p>As you approached the edge of orgasm, the lines along your body glowed and ecstasy filled your body. his hand had left your member hard, needy and leaking pre only for him to breath on it. warmth enveloped you as that single breath sent you over the edge and came, your seed flying through the air as you tried to hump the air, some of it even getting on your face.</p>“With that, the ritual may now begin” now all the figures surrounding the table removed their hoods revealing them all to be the same canid species as the high priest who just made you cum.</p>Drumming filled the air from somewhere you couldn’t see. Hands began to undo your bindings, yet made no difference as those same hands began to raise your body spread eagle and held you in place. The breaths of countless males breathing down on your naked body and the feeling of their hard-ons poking all over your body got blood pumping back into your member into half-mast only for the high priest to grab you by the balls and something cold wrap around the base of your cock and balls, not letting you get hard.</p>The pressure you felt around your loins made you look down to what he did only to be surprised to see their artifact now adorning your meager member. The gem laden gold now glinting less in your shadow making it impossibly clear for you to identify what the artifact was, a golden chastity cage.</p>Your member strained against the cage, of which was already leaking pre from being turned on by those around you.</p>You waited with baited breath, still unable to speak or move as the high priest began to chant. Black fur began to spread all along your body starting from the accursed cage, your balls became slightly bigger, along with the muscles all along your body from your now digitigrade legs to your muscular arms and bulging pecs. Small claws began to grow out of your nails and your ears began growing like trees pointing upward. Your face elongated into a snout. The hands holding you up let go one by one, followed by panting breath. You fell to the ground with a thud and looked up to the high priest, smugly smiling down on you.</p>“Rise our lord and prince, we shall get you cleaned” unable to say anything your body moved on its own taking the jackal’s hand. You were led through various hallways adorned with gold, that upon closer inspection, was placed to keep the apparently old structures together. Hand in hand he paraded you through the halls, your naked visage on display for all to see, save for the golden cage adorning your crotch. Stronger and taller you may be, but still a prisoner in the end.",

You feel like you could wander through the desert like this forever. Like this is where you were meant to be. You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you. Why do you even need clothes? You are better off without them.</p></p>You pull off your shirt and pants, tossing aside your protection from the sun. As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you.

Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

Finally, the features on your head fade over, your whole body becoming a lump of messy, weathered stone, indistinguishable from any other normal boulder in the desert.</p></p>The sandstorm slowly fades, and the rocky creature's eyes seem brighter and more alert.

Your thoughts become scrambled and confused. The sand starts to slowly cover you.</p></p>Then a shadow hovers overhead. It circles you, getting lower and lower, until a pair of clawed yellow feet land in front of your face.</p></p>\"Well well, shame that. Another adventurer out of his element, eh?\"</p></p>A pair of feather-fingered hands reach down, and start patting over you. They slide into your pockets, and take your belongings. You try to look up, and see a stocky bird, with a long featherless pink neck and a long vicious beak. The feathers at the base of his neck are ruffled out like a collar.</p></p>\"Not bad, some juicy goods here. Many thanks, lunch! I'll get myself a real nice price for one of these!\"</p></p>The vulture grins at you, and lifts his foot. His talon presses over your face, turning your head left and right as he looks down at you. You hear his stomach growl, but you are too weak to do anything at all.</p></p>He sits on your chest, and props his thick claws either side of your head. It's like being sat on by a particularly heavy pillow. He flexes his talons, and presses them to your cheeks, before rubbing your face and squeezing your head in the grip of his long avian toes.</p></p>It's oddly soothing. Your thirst and pain seems to fade away. He turns his feet, forcing you to look up into his eyes. Above him, the harsh sun glares down at you, but you barely notice. You just see the grin of that happy vulture, his bright eyes. It feels soothing, calm, happy.</p></p>\"You wanna be my lunch, bud? Want me to eat you, make me a happy stuffed vulture?\"</p></p>You do. You want to help this nice bird. He's taking all the pain away. He's soft and warm and handsome. Just a nice, friendly bird.</p></p>His beak opens wide, and leans down. You feel his tongue slide across your face, the wonderful moisture making you want to sigh. Your head presses up into his throat, so dark and cool and comfortable compared to the desert. Even if you had the strength to resist, you wouldn't. It feels so good, to have your shoulders and chest swallowed up, your body pressed into the vulture's gullet. To sink deep into the darkness, and slide down into his belly, curled up and warm and happy.</p></p>Nothing but vulture food.",

You cling to his neck for dear life, until after what seems a suspiciously short time, he stops.</p></p>You open your eyes, and realise you're back at Honest Even's shop.
