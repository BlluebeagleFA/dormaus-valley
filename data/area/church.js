There is a strong risk of death in this mission, and I cannot guarantee your safety\", he says.</p>The old wolf\'s face is surprisingly serious, with none of the vaguely-amused naughtiness you normally associate with him. You tell him you might be interested, but that you\'ll need more information. He nods, and takes you back into the church. You follow him into a room in the back, where he unrolls a large package of black felt, to reveal a small arsenal of weapons. Crossbows, gleaming silver knives, ropes and tackle, and small crystal phials that glow faintly. \"I am taking this very seriously. I have dealt with accursed before, and they are unpredictable and deadly. I will bring supplies, but I would advise you to fetch your own, along with any weapons you can muster. First, we will descend into the catacombs using an entrance in one of the crypts. From there, we must navigate the ancient passageways, and try to track the accursed. Once we identify it, we put it down. If you are willing, then meet me in the graveyard. I cannot promise you a reward that makes up for the danger involved, but I will reimburse you as best I am able\", he says.</p>He gives you a satchel of coins, and instructs you to use this to supplement your supplies.

I am grateful that the congregation is behaving, but... It makes the mind wander.” As he says it, you feel his sharp eyes sizing you up like a snack. Someone’s in a mood today.</p></p>You ask if he’s feeling sinful. Bonacieux smirks. “Me? Never. Is my favorite lamb projecting? Did you come for some quick salvation?” His predatory hands seize the front of your clothes like he’s caught a blasphemer. Using that, he forcefully tugs you into a warm embrace. </p></p>His tail’s been wagging since he saw you. “Let’s get these clothes cleaned and this sinner bathed, shall we? I’ll wash your back.” You blush. You think you smell fine. “My apologies, dear. I don’t want to be rude. I just thought you may enjoy a cleanse.” He insists. You insist back that you’re fine, even if bathing with Bonacieux is enticing.</p></p>The wolf nods. “I understand. I’ll bathe alone, then.” He plants a supple kiss to your hand before dramatically flurrying past you, robes being pulled from his body as he walks. He wouldn’t. “I did want your company, but truth be told, I’m overdue for a shampooing myself.” </p>His steps are slow and meticulous. The full width of Bonacieux’s naked back is suddenly on display, leaving the priest in only his underwear. He’s a muscular hound of a man with two melon-like asscheeks making those undies work for it. “The church is so warm and humid... I always work up a righteous stink...”</p></p>He raises one arm and makes a show of snorting his fuzzy armpit, making a grimace as he does. Then he grins over his shoulder, leaving his clothes discarded.</p></p>You are incredibly easy to manipulate. About ten minutes later, you step into the church showers to see Bonacieux has already begun soaping his beefy pectorals. “Don’t peek!” He teases and lathers himself. Yeah, yeah.</p></p>The wolf is lucky you were going to accept his proposition anyway. The water feels heavenly against your body, and the showers are well-kept. Clean. There are a whole row of shower heads lining each wall. Bonacieux is using one, and you’re facing the opposite side.</p>You want to peek. You earned the right, considering he seduced you into coming. You glance as casually as you can to observe the old wolf’s body, but you aren’t prepared. His fur is normally so shaggy. The running water reveals a heap of scars.</p></p>There’s too many to count. Slashes, burns, and holes litter the back of Bonacieux’s muscular body. It looks like hell. As quickly as you saw, you pretend you didn’t. The wolf didn’t catch on, as far as you know.</p></p>You’re so busy thinking about it you yelp when Bonacieux touches your shoulders. “Woah now!” He says. You apologize, trying not to look at the wolf looming behind you. His paws slowly return to resting on your shoulders before gliding down your arms. “Did you want your back washed? I can go, if it makes you uncomfortable.”</p></p>You touch the paw on your shoulder. Of course he can scrub your back. You tell him that. Silently, Bonacieux pulls a soapy rag along your back and rubs it into your body. “I worry for you, dear.” You look to him. He’s staring at your back with a difficult expression. “Never in all my life do I want this...” His hand presses between your shoulder blades. “To look anything like mine.”</p></p>He finishes washing you and turns off the water. A dry towel is thrown over your head. “I buried my brother. I don’t know if I can bury you too.” </p></p>Bonacieux is already rubbing himself with the towel and covering his naughty bits. You finish and do the same. He tries to say he’s sorry for making this fun outing awkward, but you tell him it’s fine. You appreciate his honesty. It must be hard for him to bare his soul so openly, so you encourage him to do it more often. It’s just as important as the sexy-priest Bonacieux. You won’t ignore how he feels.</p></p>He smiles and kisses your hand again. “Thank you, love. You know how to set an old wolf at ease.” He gives you another hug, and your clothes. They were cleaned and dried with magic. Convenient.</p></p>The two of you exit the showers. A small group greets the priest as you approach, asking for advice. Bonacieux smiles bitterly. For the first time since you’ve met, he seems reluctant to help, but you tell him to go on. You’ll come back soon.</p></p>He kisses the top of your head softly and says you’d better. And you’re alone again.",

On the other side, the wolf priest is ramming his cock into a hole between the pews, and slamming and thrusting forcefully into the blushing, bleating goat\'s ass. </p>The goat stammers something about being sorry for being such a bad bad guy, and the wolf priest growls with a feral, predatory intensity that makes you shiver. "Take my cock, you little slut, and I\'ll forgive you once your belly is full of cum." he says, his voice so rough and crude that you can\'t believe it\'s the same friendly, fatherly priest you met! The wolf snarls and drool oozes from his long fanged muzzle, and you can tell by the goat\'s bleats and shudders that his ass is being filled with hot cum. The goat starts to try to pull free, but Bonacieux rams forward so hard that he nearly crushes the wooden partition. </p>The goat yells in sudden pain as the wolf\'s swollen knot pops into his ass, tying him there until the priest is satisfied. His glowing yellow eyes turn to you, and he chuckles. "Shouldn\'t be spying, boy. You will need to be forgiven next!" he growls, and you back off, not sure if you\'re aroused or terrified.',

Animals of all races slowly filter into the church and take seats in the pews. It seems to mostly be visitors, but you notice a surprising amount declined to wear pants to this event. After a short delay, Bonacieux walks out and moves up to the lectern, where he starts to talk about peace, forgiveness, and the loving embrace of the goddess of magic. It\'s all fairly standard stuff, but every now and then, the priest grips the side of the lectern with one hand, and growls in a very deep, suggestive way. </p>Towards the end, he starts to pant and moan through every other sentence, and you notice some of the congregation are stroking themselves quietly at their seats. You get curious, and carefully move up to the front-most row of pews, at the edge where you can just barely see past the lectern that the wolf is reading from. It looks like the wolf isn\'t alone up there. Kneeling between his legs and mostly hidden by the lectern is a ram, who\'s mouth is stretched open by an enormous wolf cock, while the wolf thrusts constantly into his face. Every now and then, Bonacieux reaches down, grabs the ram\'s horns, and yanks him forward to get a better grip as he deep-throats the wooly male. </p>Bonacieux ends his lecture with a rousing speech about treating people like they deserve, during which he pulls his cock out from the sheep\'s face, and howls as he sprays his wool down with cum, leaving the dizzy ram coated in dripping, sticky wolf jizz. Bonacieux then shoves him into the lectern and slides a panel down to conceal him, before putting his cock away and helping people leave the church. While he\'s distracted, you walk over to the lectern, intending to ask the ram if he needs any help. When he hears you talking, however, he baas and grunts. "Get lost! I\'m not trading places as his fucktoy with you! I love it down here!" he says. You shrug, and leave him be.',

You push open a door and enter, wanting to check if something is wrong. Inside, you discover a long, thin weasel, with his hand inside a cabinet filled with valuable plates and gold items. Bonacieux clearly discovered him mid-theft, because he just slammed the door closed on the weasel\'s hand. </p>"Stealing from here? Unforgivable. You need a special punishment, my son", he says in a deep and rumbling growl. He picks up the weasel as easily as if he were a toy, then sits down in a large armchair, before opening his robe and lowering the black pants he wears beneath it. His long cock stands firm and erect from his grey fur, and the weasel yelps as the wolf starts to squeeze and stretch him. The weasel\'s body seems to stretch out like taffee as Bonacieux pulls him wider and wider, making him grow thinner, yet also somehow shrink. Soon, the wolf is holding a pencil-thin weasel as long as his arm, who is still wriggling and squeaking desperately. He winks at you. </p>"A little trick I learned back in my younger days", he explains. He smooths his moustache for a moment, then starts to wrap the weasel around the base of his cock in a spiral. As he does, the weasel\'s struggling and wiggling becomes slower, as his body starts to stiffen and harden. His brown fur begins to twinkle and gleam, as his flesh becomes smooth and firm, then takes on the gleaming burnished colour of gold. When the wolf finishes wrapping him around, the weasel\'s head is simply a golden lump with the carved image of a shocked weasel on it. It makes a very shiny and attractive cock ring on the older lupine\'s shaft. </p>He closes his robe again, hiding the trapped criminal, and gives you a wink. "Such is the justice of the goddess" he says, and you remind yourself never to piss off the big wolf.',

His long, furry snout is streaked with grey in the black, and his fur sticks out at the sides and chin in the shape of a soft and fluffy moustache, contrasting with the thinner fur atop his head. </p>"What troubles you, my child?" he says, his voice deep, soothing and fatherly. As you begin to tell him your worries, he nods, strokes his chin, and lowers his hands somewhere. You don\'t notice his motions, too focused on your confession. Finally, you are done, and you look over to the wolf, expecting some form of advice. </p>Instead, a small panel in the wooden partition opens, one that you hadn\'t seen before, and your eyes open wide as a long, fat cock is pressed through it. The wolf grins at you, his massive teeth gleaming in the dark of the booth. </p>"It sounds like you have been very naughty indeed, my child. I insist you redeem yourself, by debasing yourself." His voice is so deep and dominant that you can barely stammer out a response before you find yourself getting down and taking hold of the wolf\'s heavy cock. </p>His scent is masculine and virile, and you close your eyes and take him into your mouth. Your head slides forwards and backwards on the priest\'s lupine cock, your jaw aching to contain the massive manhood. He growls and urges you on as you suck. </p>"Yes, my child." "Faster, young one." "That\'s it, keep going, obey me." It doesn\'t take long before his voice descends into rough, rumbling growls, until finally he thrusts forward and howls. His cum explodes into your throat, so thick and so much that it spills from your cheeks and lips. </p>Once you have swallowed as much as you can, he slowly pulls away, and smiles at you. </p>"You are forgiven, my child.
