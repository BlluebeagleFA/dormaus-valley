Whatever punishment he has in store for you, it won't be as bad as blackening your soul with this cruel, monstrous behaviour.</p>The lizard looks pathetically grateful. There is a long, slow and terrifying silence. Vicious's expression is like a mask. You wonder, for a moment, if there is anything behind those glassy, emotionless eyes at all. Then he leans down and takes the baton...and puts it away. He walks to his desk and unhooks the rope from a hook. It slips up over a rafter on the ceiling, and the lizard falls to the ground. He scrambles to free himself, and flees. \"That will be all for today\", the warden says. You leave, quickly, half expecting a knife in your back at any moment.",

You turn to the lizardman, seeing the tears in his eyes, and picture yourself in his place, suffering and tortured by this deranged canine. Anything has to be better than that.</p>You shove the tazer into the lizard's chest, feeling his soft meat push in from the pins, and watching him thrash and shake on his ropes. He coughs and splutters through his gag, swinging and bouncing on the ropes but unable to get away or do anything to escape his predicament. You turn and glance at Vicious, who is staring unblinkingly at you.</p>You stroke the tazer slowly along the lizard's underside, making him flinch and tremble, expecting another shock at any moment. Then, once more, you zap him hard in the balls. This time, his muffled screams are mingled with a confused, painful moan, and you see cum ooze and dribble from the tip of his cage. Interesting!</p>When you turn to Vicious, his expression hasn't changed at all. He might as well be a statue. He takes the tazer from you, and steps closer. His warm body presses to yours, as his muzzle sits barely an inch from your mouth. Finally, he speaks. \"Can you see him?\", he asks. You really don't know how to reply to that.</p>Vicious spins the baton in his hand. After a moment, he shoos you out from his office. As you walk down the hallway, you can feel his stare on the back of your neck the entire way. The worst thing is...you don't feel bad about what you did.",

You realise you are staring at the lizard, and his eyes are wide, and terrified. He's shaking, and you gradually notice that you're grinning. A wide, crooked grin. The lizard is looking at you like he looks at Vicious.</p>Well, we can't have that. You should comfort him. You lean in, and press your face against the trembling lizard's mouth, as you slowly kiss him. He whimpers and struggles slightly, but lets you do it. Your tongue slides into his, and he seems to slowly calm down. He even begins to kiss back, his tongue sliding out as his shaking and fear seems to calm. Then you bite down.</p>The lizard's eyes snap open as he struggles and tries to scream. You bite harder, feeling his tongue start to bleed, and then ram the baton hard up under his chin. White-hot burning electricity explodes through you both, making him thrash and struggle, while you shake and ache with agonising, glorious pain all over. Finally, you pull the baton free, and stand up, your skin burning and hot, and blood dripping from both your mouths.</p>You don't know what is happening in your head right now. Perhaps this awful place has truly corrupted you. Whatever it is, what you do know is that the pain makes you feel alive, and excited. Both your pain, and this lizard's. His tears, his struggles. This is what you LIVE for!</p>You pull on the lizard's harness, spinning him over so he's hanging belly-up, and then you climb up onto him. His caged cock is hard and smooth under you, and you rub and grind against it a little. Gradually, by rocking and bouncing atop him, you manage to push his cage slowly inside your ass, feeling the short metal stretch your hole open. The lizard gets no pleasure from the situation, only confusion and fear. You slide the baton down his chest, watching him flinch and shake in fear. You lower it further, past yourself completely, until you slide it against his tailhole. Slowly, you start to push the thick, uncomfortable object into the lizard's ass, feeling him struggle against it. His hole stretching only very slowly, as he grunts and screams. Finally, when it is deep inside him, you twist it hard.</p>The feeling when the baton activates is indescribable. All of its electricity, unloading deep inside your helpless victim, and flowing out through him into you in a burning, agonising, heat and fire. Lightning crackling up every vein of your body. Arcing along your skin, rattling your brain and making your vision flash and shine and glow. You shake and thrash atop him, as his cage sparks and heats up, unloading volts into your ass and making you lose all control. You hump and thrust and bounce atop him, your struggles and thrashes matching his own. Your fingers clench and grip his chest tightly, your nails leaving red dripping lines in his soft belly, as you scream with what might be pain, or possibly delight. You are not sure if you know the difference anymore.</p>Finally, after what seems like hours, the baton dies. The electricity stops, and you can smell smoke and burning. You look down to see that you have soaked the lizard's crotch with orgasms that you don't even remember having. His eyes are rolled up in his head, with foam dripping from his slack-jawed mouth. He must have passed out completely.</p>You pull yourself from him, and fall to the floor, gasping and weak but delighted. You turn to look at Vicious, and he is staring wide-eyed. His pants are dripping and soaked in the crotch, and the room stinks of cum.</p>\"Go clean up, prisoner. I will come to speak to you later\", he says. His voice sounds different than usual. Is that...emotion? You give him a wink, and walk out of the room, leaving him to deal with the cleanup.",
