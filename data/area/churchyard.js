You struggle, but they won\'t move at all. </p>You feel your toes shifting and straining, and you growl strangely as your feet start to stretch out. Your toes curve out into enormous, powerful talons, and the flesh begins to turn to smooth, cold grey stone. Your legs thicken with muscle, but the power and strength comes with a bizarre and smooth coldness when your flesh turns to stone. A long, thick dragon-like tail curves out from behind you, and your hands stretch and grow as they become mighty talons, capable of crushing rock to powder. You snarl with the sound of rocks grinding together, as your back aches and throbs. Two enormous stone wings tear out from behind you, and flap in the air. </p>Your hair falls out, leaving your head smooth and grey, before two thick and heavy horns bulge out from your skull, and curve behind you. Your face becomes stern and fierce as your mouth and nose pushes forward into a beak-like muzzle, filled with sharp stone teeth. Your feet finally move again, and you stumble and fall from the pedestal. Your wings flap, and you land heavily in the soil. You feel incredibly powerful and deadly, and your insides are as cold and still as stone.',

A fox adventurer is sitting pantsless on the grass, moaning and humping with his tail raised. When you get closer, you see that there is another fox, or something like one. Atop the adventurer is a ghostly, faint blue image of a fox with a horny, lustful grin. </p>The ghost\'s translucent cock is ramming into the living fox\'s ass, and he\'s feeling it as if it were as solid as any real cock. You hear a faint voice, sinister yet almost like just noise in the wind. "Yes, cum for me. Release your life essence!" it says. The living fox whimpers, and strokes his own throbbing cock, before moaning and spraying his cum all over the grass. When he does, his orange fur starts to look strange. His cock is still leaking and spraying something, but it almost looks like glimmering, shining sparkles, that are flowing out from him and up into the ghostly fox above. </p>The living fox\'s cock starts to turn transparent and ghostly, and he yelps as he looks at his hands and realises he can see right through them! Slowly, his orange fades to an icy, barely-visible blue, and he begins to float up off the ground. He turns and spins, confused and aroused, until the other fox ghost grabs him and squeezes him possessively. </p>The other ghost is much more visible now, almost like a floating blue ordinary fox. "Your life force felt great, new guy. You\'ll make a fun little ghost slave for me." he whispers. The wind rises up suddenly, and you are forced to blink. When you open your eyes, you see no one in the churchyard with you at all.',
