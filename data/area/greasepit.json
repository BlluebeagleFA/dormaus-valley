While there are a few empty tables, all of them are far too close to another rowdy table for your comfort. You decide to sit down at the bar, hoping you won’t attract too much attention. As you’re about to sit down, the leather-clad panther beckons you over with a cigarette in his hand. “Are you new here? I haven’t seen your face before.” You nod in response as you take a seat beside him instead. Now that you’re up close, you notice his vibrant amber eyes, accompanied by a warm smile that feels out of place for this establishment. “Let me warn you; places like these aren’t safe alone. Next time you go to a new place, do bring a friend.” You can’t help but nod meekly once again, taken back by his amiability. “Anyhow… May I ask your name?” Once again, you’re caught off guard by how direct he was; you can’t help but stutter as you give him your name. “That is quite a nice name. You can call me Alder. It’s nice to meet you.” He brought his paw forwards — the only part besides his face not covered in leather — and you shook hands, keeping your eye contact with the panther however difficult it was.</p>He begins asking you a few questions such as ‘What do you do’ and ‘What got you to come here.’ With each question, you found yourself more confident speaking, and you had a jolly chat together, though in the back of your mind there was an odd itching; you couldn’t quite get why.“Do you smoke, friend?” the panther asked out of the blue, “You’ve been looking strangely at my cigarette this entire time. You want a smoke?” Truth be told, while you had tried your best to ignore it, there had been an ever-present scent that seemed to ensnare your mind. You had, of course, enjoyed your time with the panther so far, but somewhere in the back of your mind, you felt as if that wasn’t the sole thing keeping you here. “Or were you bothered by the smoke? I can put it out if you-” you interrupted the panther as he was about to stuff the butt into an ashtray, insisting that you just didn’t smoke often. Of course, that was a lie, but it felt as if it’d be the right thing to say.</p>Whether the panther saw through your lie didn't matter. His voice was cheerful, nonetheless, as he grinned, “I’m glad! I should’ve offered you sooner it seems — how rude of me!” He took out a cigarette and lit it, placing it on your lips. You’d never smoked before, yet it came so naturally to you as you took a long drag of the cigarette. Relaxing your shoulders and slumping down, your entire system calmed in an instant. “You were looking nervous before - you just needed a smoke, didn’t you?” The panther patted your shoulder for a short while, breaking any remaining personal space between you. “You like it, friend?” You’re almost lost in bliss, his ever-so-warm words only barely bringing you to a conscious state of mind. “I feel like I’m on cloud nine...” you utter thoughtlessly, blowing a cloud of smoke back into the panther’s face, who's seemingly unfazed.</p>You continue your conversation for another hour or so, bumming a few more smokes throughout that time, which the panther seemed not to mind one bit. “So, where do you come from, friend?” the panther asked. You tell him that while you sleep most nights in Dormaus, you’re an adventurer, unbound by the notion of a home. He grinned at the mention of Dormaus, and soon began to speak, “That’s where I come from too!” he exclaimed in a raised voice, “though I sold my house after I got my bike — I spent most of my time on the road from that point onwards. A happy village life just isn’t for me.” You both chatter for a while, asking each other mundane questions.</p>Uncharacteristically, he averts his gaze away from you, his eyes widening as he coughed to halt the conversation. “It’s getting really late. Do you need a lift home?” You look behind yourself; a large mechanical clock on the wall shows that it’s far past midnight. You appreciate the offer, but you tell him that you’re just fine walking; an adventurer is always prepared for anything. However, he insists, “I wouldn’t feel good letting you go on your own. You look as if you could fall asleep at any moment.” He blows a gentle puff of smoke straight into your face. You admit that you do feel tired, and take him up on his generous offer. The panther smiles warmly and places a hand on your shoulder. “Just come outside with me then. I only have one helmet, but I promise I’ll drive carefully, my friend.” You both walk out of the bar, having spent the entire night without ordering a single item. The wolverine bartender didn’t seem to mind, though; a bit of quiet was probably worth more than any coin you could give to him.</p>He seats you up on his bike, and not long after, you are riding along a path through the woods, straight back to Dormaus. While the night air is sharp and cold, you feel none of it; with your arms wrapped around Alder, you feel warm and at ease, soon dozing off cuddled up close to him. You wake up to rays of sunlight coming from a window. Opening your eyes, you find yourself in a room inside the Two Feathers Inn, laying on a bed with clothes on. It takes you a few moments to gather yourself before remembering what transpired last night. You realize you never asked him where he lived or where to find him. The rest of your morning was relatively uneventful. Most of it was spent thinking about Alder. Whenever you closed your eyes, all you could see was his warm smile. Something deep inside of you assured you that you’d meet him again soon, and that put you in a good mood for the rest of the day.",

                "text":"With no hesitation, you walk over to the bar and take a seat by your friend Alder. At first, he doesn’t seem to notice you at all, his eyes closed and his body relaxed as puffed on his cigarette. Without opening an eye, he speaks out in a cold, intimidating voice. “What’re you looking at? You got a problem?” Fear strikes down your body — had you actually gone up to a complete stranger that just happened to look like him? You apologize nervously as you stand up again. The panther turns towards you and flicks your nose as he laughs audibly throughout the bar, bringing at least a few eyes peering over towards you.</p>“I’m jesting, my friend! Just relax and have a seat; I will do you no harm.” He kept on chuckling, hardly able to contain himself.“Since I gave you such a scare, I’ll make up for it.” He coughed before calling out using a voice louder than the one he’d speak to you with, “Bartender, get my friend a mug of the good stuff.” The wolverine bartender nodded, and by the time you realized who Alder was speaking to, a heavy mug was almost slammed down in front of you, its contents a pale amber color. “Have a drink; it’s on me.” He grinned as you took a big gulp of the beverage in front of you. It wasn’t particularly strong, though it gave a nice, mild buzz that helped drown out the remaining embarrassment that lingered from the panther’s previous prank.</p>“How have you been since we met last? I hope I dropped you off in the right room.” As always, the moment he began to speak, he directed all his attention at you, his voice gentle and relaxing. You assured him everything went well — that he had nothing to worry about. “I see. That is a relief! I was afraid I might have caused you trouble.” You shake your head to insist once more. You move on to tell him how you'd been, though you left out the part about how you haven't been able to stop thinking about him every now and then.</p>“May I ask you then, why you came here alone again? I thought I had warned you not to go to seedy places like this alone... unless you came here expecting to find me? Is that it?” A cheeky smile found its place on his face, clearly bantering with you now. “I won't blame you. I have that effect on people. I'm glad you came so we could meet again.” You felt your cheeks flush a little. Though you attempted to hide it by taking another swig from your mug, it didn't take a genius to realize that nothing would get past Alder's attentive gaze.</p>As you placed down your beverage on the table and looked back at your friend, you could see him fidgeting with a small pack, taking out a cigarette and holding it out towards you. “Want a smoke? You still seem a little stiff.” You could've sworn you hadn't felt anything, yet the moment he mentioned it, your hands and feet felt slightly tingly; your mouth felt dry — more importantly, you found yourself unable to relax at all. You accepted the cigarette with a smile and thanked him. Your hand went down into your pocket to search for your lighter — did you even have one?</p>Alder handed you a lighter with a faint chuckle. “Here, my friend. Feel free to keep it too — think of it as a present.” You nodded, placing the cigarette on your lips and lighting it. As if on instinct, you took a long, deep drag, feeling the buzz hit you like waves on a beach. Your shoulders eased down, and the tension in your muscles all faded away in the span of seconds. With your eyes closed, you blew out a cloud of smoke straight into the panther's face. Usually, you'd apologize for it, yet with Alder, you felt at ease. He just reciprocated it with his own smoke. “You look much better now, friend. Another time, don't hesitate to bum off of me, I mind not one bit.” The rest of the night was spent chattering and smoking. The first few times you tried to be humble and reject his offers, but he insisted on giving you a cigarette each time you finished the last one. You caved in every time; it was hard to say no to his smile.</p>“So, have you ever had any relationships? You may be an adventurer, but surely you’ve had at least a crush on someone, no?” You explain that you’ve indeed had a few crushes and a couple of short-lived relationships, but that you’ve mostly been delegating yourself to one-night stands and such. You inquire him about his own experiences, not wanting to be the only one to share embarrassing topics about yourself. “There was a guy I crushed on when I lived in Dormaus,” he began speaking softly as his cheeks flushed faintly, “we always disagreed about whether pipes or cigarettes were better, but we always had a great time together. I never told him; the age difference was too big back then...  nowadays it might be different.” It came as a bit of a surprise to you that Alder was into men — though, in hindsight, that wasn’t too uncommon around here, you’d just been far too used to every gay person you met attempting to flirt with you or transform you.</p>Your chatters get drowned out by a loud ruckus, a group of bears slams open the door and walk up to the bar, taking up most of the seats. While sure, the bar was not a quiet place before, they were the loudest and most obnoxious people to enter all night by a long shot, and at least most of the louder groups kept to the tables, rather than the bar. Not long after places Alder a hand on your shoulder and leans in close to speak with you. “It’s getting pretty late. I think it’s best that we leave, don’t you think my friend?” He eyes at the bears, hoping you’d get the hint. You both stand up and head out of the bar, his arm wrapped around your shoulder as if protecting you.</p>The air outside was cold and refreshing, a much-needed change from the stuffy bar. Your amber eyes dilating in the dark. You’d felt sluggish just few moments before, yet energy circulated back as you walked over to Alder’s bike. You could’ve sworn it was much harder finding it last time, though perhaps he’d just parked it in the same place as last. The two of you jump up on his bike, your arms wrapped around his chest to keep you on it, and not long after are you driving through the woods back towards Dormaus yet again. You feel awake and more alive than ever, and unlike last time, you spend most of the time chatting, continuing where you had been interrupted before, though you hadn’t many interesting topics left, so you mostly talked about the scenery.</p>One thing was unchanged from last time though — you kept close to him as you clung on, feeling his radiating warmth protect you from the wind brushing off your skin. At the speed he was driving at, you’d find yourself badly scraped if you fell off, and that’s ignoring instant death from a head injury. Despite that, you felt safe with Alder, however irrational that might be. “Are you alright back there? You’re hugging me pretty tightly. Should I go slower?” Your face went red in embarrassment — you could swear the panther saw it and was grinning, despite how unfeasible that’d actually be. “I’ll get you back in one piece, don’t you worry. We’re almost there.” His words soothed and calmed you, just as they always did. For the rest of the ride, you didn’t speak much, and after a short while Alder caught on and allowed you to focus on the view, the sound of the motorcycle’s engine revving remaining as the only sound to be heard.</p>About five minutes later, you’re driving past the gates of Dormaus. The town feels much different at this time of night. The streets which are usually lively instead devoid of people, barring the occasional adventurer or foreigner unaware of the dangers of walking alone at night. As you reach the inn, you jump off, and he parks the bike along one of the walls. “Whoo, I don’t think I’ve enjoyed a ride this much in ages.” Alder laughed as he took off his helmet. “Well, here we are. You do have enough to pay for a room, right?” You nod quietly. “That’s good. I’ll be staying at a friend’s place here tonight. Perhaps we could meet at the fountain in the morning and have breakfast together?” You smile and accept the offer.</p>As you’re about to say your farewells, he hands you a half-emptied pack of cigarettes. “I’ve got another pack left in my pocket so you can have the rest in this one.” He jumps back up on his bike and drives away as you wave. He’s quickly gone into the night, and you enter the inn and walk up the stairs to your room. You place the lighter and the cigarettes on the table and start undressing. Falling asleep came to be a difficult task as you tossed and turned; you ended up spending quite a while staring at the ceiling deep in thought. “Perhaps I should have a smoke? Today was pretty wild after all…” you pondered with yourself, “I’ll just have one to relax and then go to bed” You took out a cigarette from the pack and lit it, opening a window so as to not stink up the room.</p>As you sat there on your bed with moonlight shining in from the window, you felt at ease. Each inhalation of smoke replaced stress you didn’t even know you had. This was the first quiet moment you’d had all day since you entered the bar. Everything was so quiet you could hear the faint sounds of the night — crickets chirping, the occasional footsteps of a passerby walking outside. You think to yourself, “I can see why he likes them so much…” as you take another drag of smoke. Once the cigarette’s burned out, you toss the butt out of the window and lay yourself back in your bed. With your newfound state of relaxation, you were fast asleep.",

                "text":"The barkeeper, a tall and stocky wolverine, raps the table and draws your attention. \"Hey, kid. This one's from the wolves\", he says. He slides a glass of whiskey towards you, and you pick it up hesitantly. The wolves are all staring at you with wide grins, their yellow eyes glowing in the dim light of this ratty bar. You get the impression that refusing their gift might be quite dangerous, so you hold your nose and gulp down the drink. It's sharp, and bitter, and tastes like you'd imagine gasoline to taste.</p>When you cough and put the glass down, you feel a tingling on the back of your neck. You turn around on your bar stool to see the three wolves standing right behind you. Now that you get a closer look, you can see they're all wearing very similar clothing. Heavy leather jackets, white vests, dark trousers, and boots. Their hair is slicked back with a curve in the front that juts out. \"Hey there, buddy. Enjoy the drink? You know you gotta pay us back now\", one of them says. They leer at you, and the one leaning against the bar pulls out a butterfly knife and starts to play with it idly.</p>You ask what they want from you, and they glance at eachother. \"Oh, nothin' much friend. We're just lookin' for a new member for our gang! Why don't you try it out, and if you don't like it, you can leave. No questions asked!\", he says. You reluctantly agree, and suddenly the lead wolf grabs you and yanks you forward. Your face is shoved firmly into his warm armpit, and you struggle and wriggle in his grasp. Your nose is forced into his furry, damp pits, with his leather jacket draped against the side of your cheek. One of the other wolves flicks open what looks like a switchblade, but actually turns out to be a comb. He begins to comb your hair as you struggle, slicking it back and curving it out. With each stroke of the comb, your hair becomes darker and shinier, becoming greased back just like theirs. Your ears start to stretch, becoming longer and pointier, and your face grows and pushes out into a long muzzle. You feel your nose bulging and turning dark, and the stink of musky, sweaty male wolf floods into your nostrils and makes you feel light headed and dizzy.</p>The wolf releases you, and you fall backwards, your head swimming and your long new muzzle feeling strange as you touch your teeth with your tongue. One of the wolves pulls your clothes off, his gloved hands stroking over your chest and back, then sliding down your legs. Where he touches you, your skin tingles and itches, as thick, soft black wolf fur starts to grow in, which his fingers brush and stroke through. His hands slide down your inner thighs and down to your feet. As he strokes and squeezes your feet in his grip, and you feel them start to stretch and grow, one of the other wolves pulls off his huge, dusty leather boots. The other wolf wriggles out of his pants, and together they hold you down as they force the dark pants up your body, the tight fabric squeezing around your stronger, thicker legs. Then, they push the heavy boots onto your feet, and you feel your bare paws sliding into the dark, damp leather and pressing down into them. It's almost like you're absorbing the musk and dirt and essence of your fellow gang members, as your feet stretch and grow to fill the boots, becoming large, clawed paws.</p>Two of them grab you by the arms and lift you up, and you look over at the other wolves, a grin starting to spread on your face. Your mind is confused and dizzy, and your expression almost doesn't feel like your own. The lead wolf slides his leather jacket down off his shoulders, and then pulls it over you. You push your arms into the heavy, creaking sleeves, and feel the weight of it around you. You shiver with pleasure as it strokes against your bare fur. Instinctively, you reach for a comb, and one of your gangmates presses one into your paw. You comb your hair, adjusting it until it's perfect, and smirk at them.</p>One of them slides his hand down and gropes your ass, and you growl with pleasure at the feeling. Your tailbone aches and stretches, pushing through a hole in the pants and growing, before developing thick, bushy fur. Your gang leader whistles with admiration as he sees your tail wag, and he pushes you against the bar, your ass in the air. \"Time to break in the new gang member, boys!\", he howls.</p>They pull down your pants and you lift your rear eagerly, as you feel your gang leader's huge, powerful body press against your back. His hot, musky form pushes against you, his muzzle growls and rumbles against your neck, and you feel his cock push against your tailhole. The pressure grows and builds, until finally, with a pop and a thrust, he penetrates you. You snarl and shudder as he starts to pump his cock into you, pounding in and out. Breaking you in. His thick red rocket shoves deep and almost knots you, but he grips onto his knot and squeezes it in his palm instead. His thick, hot cum gushes into your ass, filling you with heat, and he howls with pleasure.</p>Slowly, he pulls himself out, and before you can even get a chance to catch your breath, the next wolf wraps his arms around you, snarls, and shoves his cock into your slippery, cum-soaked ass. You see now why he didn't want to knot you.</p>The three wolves take turns using your ass all night. By the time the third is done, the first is ready to try out your new muzzle, and it carries on like that until daybreak, when you are left panting, sweaty and soaked in jizz. You love your new gang.",

He says something to the bartender in a thick, growling voice, and the wolverine behind the bar slams down a dirty glass with a deep, swirling green drink in it.</p>The other two orcs get up and stand behind you. The leader grunts again, and his thick, huge tusks move as he speaks. \"Drink\", he commands.</p>You hesitate, and the orc nods to his companions. They grab your arms in their huge, rough green hands, and hold you back as the orc leader grabs the glass and forces it to your lips. You struggle, and much of it spills down your chin, but you end up swallowing a large portion of the burning, sharp liquid. You immediately begin to feel dizzy and confused, your vision starting to blur and split 50/50.</p>The orcs release you, and you struggle to your feet. Your skin feels hot and itchy. You start to rub and stroke over your chest and arms, as your body feels more and more intensely sensitive. Your skin flushes with deep, grassy colour, and you find yourself pushing at your clothes, desperate to not have them brushing agaisnt you right now. The orcs eagerly assist you, as they manhandle and grope you, pulling off your clothing and tossing it aside, until you are left naked and panting, with sweat running down your body as your skin is filled completely with that dark green shade just like theirs.</p>The lead orc pulls you up, and grips around your bare waist with his muscular, scarred arm as he holds you naked against him. You pant and squirm, struggling as every touch seems to make you throb with pleasure and desperation. \"This why orcs not wear clothes, new blood\", he grunts. Your brain feels foggy and slow and dizzy, but you vaguely realise that he's speaking in his guttural, brutish orc language, and yet you can understand him.</p>As he holds you, the other two orcs start to grope and tease you. Their hands stroke over your feet, making them grow thicker and wider, as your soles become tough and leathery and firm. They squeeze and rub your legs, making you moan and struggle, while your thighs and calves bulge and harden with thick, strong muscles. The lead orc uses his free hand to slap your ass, and then grasp it firmly, feeling it thicken and bulge into a big, soft round bubble butt. He pants and growls with a lusty, aroused sound, while your belly grows rounder and harder, like a tough green beer barrel. Your arms bulge, your biceps inflating as large as footballs, with an equally leathery skin. Finally, the lead orc grips and rubs his dirty hand over your face, making your jaw crack and jut forward, as your lower teeth stretch and thicken, curving out into big thick tusks.</p>The lead orc shoves you to the ground, and the others approach you with a dirty leather loincloth that stinks of musky orc balls, and a leather harness. They wrap the harness around your chest, and the loincloth around your wide green waist. \"Perfect look for new orc breeder\", one of them says.</p>You're still too dizzy to get up, managing only to push yourself up into a crawl, when your head suddenly pushes into the stinking, sweaty crotch of one of the orcs. His loincloth is gone, and his low-hanging green balls are shoved against your chin. His huge, thick green cock flops against your cheek, and rises as it hardens. The sweaty foreskin drawing back as his shaft inflates and grows out to its full length. He grips your face, and shoves his swollen dark-green cockhead into your mouth, before starting to vigorously and roughly fuck your throat. Your body feels hot and starts to throb with pleasure, as your confused and sluggish brain seems to focus on how good it feels to be used by manly warrior orcs.</p>The lead orc walks behind you, his huge bare feet stomping on the ground, and drops his own loincloth. He spits on his hand and rubs it over his gigantic dirty green cock, then grips your ass in both hands, and shoves forward. You gag on the cock in your throat as you feel your hole stretching to fit him, his length sliding deeper and deeper inside you and filling you from behind. He pulls out with a slick, wet sound, and then rams in, over and over, as you are used from both ends like the orc slut you are. They use you for what feels like hours, bruising and fucking you, as the stink of strong, dominant orcs fills the tavern. When the one fucking your mouth pulls out and you gasp for breath, you barely get a moment's rest before the other orc rams his way into you and they carry on. Finally, the orc in your mouth pushes in hard, grunts, and starts to unload thick ropes of hot, sticky cum deep into your throat. The lead orc leans over you and pants as you feel him cum too, releasing the heat of his seed deep into your ass. Finally, the third orc who is stroking and pumping his cock next to you, sprays your face and back with his dripping musky cum. \"You ours now, breeder orc\", the leader says, and the three of them leave you lying there covered and filled with orc seed.",

Follow me.\"</p>You follow the muscular wolverine into a room near the back of the grungy biker bar. You realise what the room is before entering, because it stinks of piss and sweat. You hesitate before going forward, but your curse starts to rise up, making you drool as you think you might be getting to taste the wolverine's hot piss. You nervously take another step, only for the wolverine to grab you and suddenly shove you down into an empty toilet stall. You end up stumbling on the broken ceramic remains of what was probably a toilet, smashed in the aftermath of a transformation or a bar brawl.</p>\"Here you go, free drink\" the wolverine grunts. His thick, sweaty black cock is already pointed at you, and he grips it in his rough hand before starting to relieve himself. As acrid, stinking piss flows over your face, you find yourself opening your mouth and letting him direct the stream directly over your tongue. The wolverine's piss is acrid and sharp, and the stench of it stings your nostrils.</p>You find yourself gulping down mouthfuls of the wolverine's piss, the vile taste of it starting to grow on you moment by moment. It warms and fills your stomach, and you find yourself feeling dizzy and tired. You have no idea how long the ram spends pissing on you, but finally he leaves without giving you a second glance.</p>You try to stand up and follow him, but your body doesn't respond. Your skin feels cold, and your limbs are stiff. You try to gasp out a cry for help, but your voice just gurgles and bubbles. A wolf enters the room, a chubby and heavy-set man in a jumpsuit. He doesn't seem to notice anything odd about you, and he nonchalantly pulls his thick musky wolf cock out from his fly and begins to piss into your still-open mouth. You find yourself unable to close it, and unable to stop yourself from swallowing his hot, salty urine. Your skin stiffens more, and begins to turn pale and smooth. Your rear starts to lean down against the ground, and the rusty remains of the previous toilet's plumbing pipe juts against your ass. You feel it slide up into you, and begin to fuse with your body. You desperate attempts to call out to the wolf go unheeded, as he leaves you in the filthy bathroom.</p>Your mouth and head change more, as they stretch out into a large bowl, and some of the remains of the wolf's urine sits at the back of your throat. It would seem you will be helping out in this bar after all - as a toilet.</p>The next person to enter the bathroom is a fat, hairy biker pig. You can barely do anything but bubble and gurgle at him, which he does not notice at all. He pulls out his fat, short cock from his leather pants, and begins to piss. His stream is messy and sprays all over your skin, leaving yellow stains. Despite your mouth now being lifeless ceramic, you can taste every drop of his rancid, dark-yellow piss. His massive boot slides over and shoves down on your crotch, and there is a loud flushing sound as you are forced to swallow. When he pulls his boot away, your crotch is left as a normal foot-pedal flushing device.</p>It seems your fate is sealed, as there is nothing left to distinguish you from any other toilet in this dirty run-down place. At the end of the day, the wolverine returns. He looks down at you, piss filling your bowl and staining your porcelain. \"Told ya you would get the drinks you needed, dumbass\", he says. He grips his sweaty cock and starts to pump it in his rough, dirty hand. The scent of his musk and arousal fills the room, and he pants and growls. Finally, cum begins to spurt and spray from his cock, splattering over the back of your throat and dripping down your rim.</p>Briefly, you hope that it will transform you into something else. Even the wolverine's obedient slut would be better than this. Unfortunately, that is not the case. You are just a toilet. \"Keep up the good work\", he says with a chuckle, and leaves you to your fate.",

You land on your usual stool with a thud, and reach back around behind you to grope one of them as they walk away. His cock throbs through his jeans as you squeeze him, and you growl possessively.</p>The fat wolf at the bar pants and wiggles on his seat, his tongue lolling. \"I'm so glad you're back boss!\", he barks. He presses his muzzle closer to you, and you scratch him under the chin, before lifting your arm. You know what he likes. The chubby wolf's tail wags rapidly as he presses his nose to your furry armpit and breathes in deeply. While he starts to lick and nuzzle at your pits, the bartender pours you your usual drink, and you chug it down in one gulp. It's good to be home.",

                "text":"\"Who wants a free drink?\", you yell. A few people look over, and quickly get the picture when you squeeze your bulging crotch with one rough handpaw. Some of them argue among eachother, but first dibs ends up going to a heavy-set squirrel. He walks over to you, grinning widely. Despite his chubby cheeks and round belly, he has a fair bit of swagger to him, with some thick burly arms and some nice leathers. Heavy boots, huge belt buckle, and a chunky leather jacket hanging open over his bare belly. You look at his slicked-back hair and scratch your chin.</p>\"Terry, wasn't it? Think I remember you coming in with Mike and his crew\", you say. Terry kneels down in front of you and nods, his huge tail curling behind him. \"Damn, didn't think you'd remember me. Haven't seen you around much these days Borus. Glad I got a chance to taste your daddy knot, big guy\", he says. You raise an eyebrow at being called a daddy. You're not quite sure how you feel about that quite yet! Still, it is getting you going.</p>You unbuckle your belt, and push down your pants, letting your sheath hang out and start to reveal the swelling bulge of your fat red rocket. Terry breathes in deeply, filling his lungs with your rough manly scent, and he almost starts drooling. Once your cock actually swells up and fills out, his eyes widen and he grins. \"Oh fuck man, they told me you were thick! Try not to break my jaw\", he gasps. You grin and take hold of his head with one hand. \"No promises\", you growl, before forcing the tip of your gleaming red wolf cock into his mouth.</p>The squirrel has clearly done this plenty of times before. He opens his mouth wide, and even when your shaft pushes down the back of his throat, he doesn't gag. His tongue licks and rubs against your shaft, and he presses his face forward into your crotch as he starts to suck and gulp on your throbbing cock like a pro.</p>You lean back, letting the squirrel do the work while you reach over and grab another drink. Droplets of booze splash onto his head as you guzzle it down, but your disdainful behaviour only seems to get him more excited. He reaches into his pants and starts to pump his own cock, his sucking getting faster and harder as he gets more into it.</p>You grunt and shudder as your knot starts to bulge up. It swells and thickens, and you press it firmly against his mouth. You figure you're not going to get it past his wide buck teeth, but the short guy surprises you when he stretches his mouth wide, holds onto your hips, and grunts. He pushes his nose deep into your crotch fur, and you feel your knot shove into his mouth, your cock now deeply thrust far enough into his throat that you swear you can see his neck bulge.</p>That eagerness sends you over the edge. You grab his head and press him between your legs as you start to cum into him, your cock gushing and spraying hot jizz deep into his throat. He moans and shakes, his face flushed, and when he pulls his hand out from his pants, cum is dripping in a mess between his fingers.</p>You sigh and lean back, grinning. That was damn good. The squirrel tries to pull free, but just ends up tugging on your knotted cock. \"Don't rush it\", you tell him. He realises his predicament, and mutters a swear of some sort. You end up enjoying two more beers at a leisurely pace, with him stuck between your legs, before your cock finally softens enough that he can pull free.",

                "text":"You lick your lips and growl as you look over at the fresh meat near the bar. You sniff slowly, moving your gaze around the various patrons, looking for a particularly good one. There! The human sitting at a booth in the corner. You breathe in slowly and deeply, tasting his scent. He's surrounded by a trembling smell of fear, but also excitement and lust. Definitely a submissive, and from the weakness of his male scent, not a good fit for joining a leather wolf pack. You snap your fingers to get the bartender's attention, then gesture to the human. The ram at the bar nods, and pours you out an amber coloured drink.</p>You hop off your barstool and walk over to the human. He looks up at you and backs away slightly, before realising that sitting in that booth gives him no real way to sneak away once the entryway is filled up by a scruffy, horny wolf. Your teeth gleam in the dim light.</p>\"Hey cute stuff. You here all on your own?\", you growl. He hesitates, then nods. You step forward into the booth and take a seat next to him, then place your drink on the table. Your leather jacket creaks as you lift an arm and slide it around his shoulders. Watching carefully, you can see the precise moment he gets a deep, close-up breath of your scent. His face flushes pink, and his eyes take on a distant, blurry look. You press your long muzzle against his neck, and let your hot breath blow over his tender skin.</p>\"You don't want to be human any more, I can smell it. Try to deny it, boy\", you say. He shudders, and nods. You place one rough hand on his chest, and press him down onto the sticky, dirty bar bench. He tries to say something as you start to pull off his shirt, but you just place your hand over his mouth and muffle him. You're in charge now. His crotch visibly tents as you strip him, and he lifts his arms to help you do it. Soon, he's naked and trembling underneath you. You roll him over, and slide your hand over his smooth, round bubble butt. With your other hand, you pull down your pants, and stroke your throbbing, thick red cock.</p>\"This is gonna hurt, slut. But you'll learn to love it\", you say with a chuckle. The human clenches his eyes shut as you press your thick cock against his rear, and start to force it in. Damn, he's tight as fuck! You push and pull, inch by inch, very slowly stretching out his rear and invading him bit by bit. He bites his lip, alternating between whimpers of pain and moans of intense pleasure. As you sink into him deeper and deeper, you reach over to your drink, and start to dribble it slowly over his back.</p>He makes a confused noise, but doesn't resist you, even as you pour the cold liquid over his neck and hair. His dark hair starts to lighten, turning from black to a soft brown, before spreading down his neck and over his back. He gasps and grins, and then moans loudly as you run your hand through his thick, soft curly new fur. It spreads all along his bare back, and down to his butt. You shove your cock in another inch as his insides loosen a little, and you chuckle at the feeling.</p>\"Th-thank you! I've always wanted to be a wolf\", he gasps. You don't reply, and instead just thrust yourself more inside him, and lean down so that your body is pressing against his back. Your knot is touching his ring now, as your cock fills and stretches his tight hole. His ears stretch up and grow, and his flat human face lengthens out into a muzzle, as shorter, lighter-coloured fur covers his new face. He lifts up his hand eagerly to watch it change, and you chuckle when you see his delighted expression change to confusion. His fingers start to fuse together, turning dark, hard and black, as they become thick and chunky hoof-fingers. You tease his tail with your hand, tugging on the short tufty furry limb, and he makes a yelping bleat sound when his neck starts to lengthen and thicken.</p>With a grunt, you force your swollen knot into the new llama's tight little ass, feeling it pop inside with a rush of incredible pleasure. It's enough to make you start drooling, and your saliva drips and splatters along the llama's back. You can smell his fear growing more and more, like a sharp, tangy acrid scent spreading around him. You close your hand around his thick, soft neck, and lift him up before slamming him down on the table under you.</p>He looks around, helplessly pinned under you, as the many predators and dangerous beasts in the bar all turn to give him grins and winks. If he's lucky, they're horny looks. If not...well, he came to a wolf bar willingly, he should know the risks.</p>You shove his face onto the bar, lift your neck up, and howl as you start to cum inside him. Your thick, hard wolf cock gushing thick hot cum into his tight llama butt, a nice cream filling for a soft and wooly prey beast.</p>\"Get nice and comfy, meat, because you're gonna be sitting here for the next ten minutes with my knot in your ass. After that, well, things might get more complicated for you\", you whisper in his ear. He whimpers pathetically, and the sound of it gives you a little rush that makes you shoot up a bit more cum inside him.</p>A shorter wolf walks over and hands you a drink, and you gulp it down. For the next ten minutes, you mostly ignore the helpless beast impaled on your cock. Once you soften up, you pull yourself free, and walk away. As you zip up your pants, you hear a small crowd of your fellow preds all walk up to the whimpering llama.</p>You love this fucking bar.",

He's even fatter than you, with a scruffy beard and a zigzag scar across his eye. Crook, named for his scar. He's had his one good eye on being the gang leader for years.</p>\"What the HELL do you think you're doing in my seat, Crook?\", you spit. He turns around slowly, a mug of YOUR special ale in his fat paw. He gives you a grin.</p>\"I ain't in your seat, that's right there\", he says. He points down with one gloved hand, at the floorboards under the stool. The wolf next to him stifles a chuckle. \"Take a seat, I've been waiting to rest my boots on a footstool\", he says.</p>You glance down at said boots, the pair of thick and heavy black leather ones that Crook is wearing. The buckles are tarnished, and the bottoms are caked with mud. You drag your eyes away from them after a moment.</p>\"Who the fuck are you calling a footstool?\", you growl, but there's an edge of nervousness in your voice you can't hide. Crook grins, and the edge of his mouth shifts awkwardly where it meets the scar.</p>\"See, we was runnin' some powders up past Dormaus Village the other day, an' we ended up crossin' paths with an old mate of yours\", he says. The short, scrawny wolf next to him pipes up. \"The yote! That one who won't hang with us\", he says. Crook thumps him to shut him up.</p>\"Well, that yote told us somethin' interesting about our boss Borus. Said you is a sweat-huffin, toe suckin, submissive little bitch boy who gets on all fours to kiss his feet\", Crook says.</p>You growl louder, baring your fangs at this obviously completely false slander. You crack your knuckles and prepare to lay some sense into this cocky usurper, when suddenly a familiar scent hits your nostrils. You feel your cheeks flushing, your knees going weak. Crook is reaching into his inside pocket, and he draws out a damp, warm, stinking sock, the sole matted and stained with dirt. That's...Master Ace's scent.</p>Crook reaches his hand forward, and you really do try to resist. To step back, or bat his hand away, but that smell is just...so...good. Then he presses that damp filthy sock over your nose, and your eyes half-lid over as you whine like a puppy and fall to your knees.</p>One of the older wolves, a grey-bearded heavyset one, rubs his hand over his face and shakes his head. \"Fuck me, it's true. Borus has gone soft. I guess I owe you a drink, Crook\", he mutters. The short giggly wolf next to Crook reaches down and tugs on Crook's oversized boot, slowly pulling it and sliding it until his damp, dirty sock-covered paw is revealed. The humid musk of unwashed biker wolf stink flows over you. \"You like that, bitch?\", the shorter wolf says. Crook growls at him, and he goes quiet, but then Crook lifts his foot and stretches his toes, causing the fabric to move and shift.</p>\"You like that? Want to be under my feet, footstool?\", he asks. You nod before you can even think about it, your mouth drooling with desire. Crook reaches down, and his dirty fingers press against your mouth as he pulls your jaw open. You taste nicotine and dirt on his fingertips when he pushes them into your mouth and over your tongue. He takes Ace's dirty sock, crumples it into a ball, and shoves it firmly into your open mouth, before pushing it back and packing it tight inside your maw. The dirty, dry taste of the sock lingers on your tongue.</p>\"I'm the boss of this gang now, footstool. You're nothing. Boys, strip this thing down, I don't see any wolf here and I don't see why a footstool would be wearing our leathers\", Crook growls. The wolves around you close in, their rough hands pulling off your jacket, pinning you down, tearing off your boots and pants and soon leaving you naked and helpless. When you sit back up, you see Crook reach down and slowly peel off the sock stretched around his paw. It's literally dripping with sweat - you see a droplet fall to the floor as he peels it off his rank and filthy footpaw. He squeezes it, and then shoves it into your mouth, filling the remaining space and totally gagging you. This sock is so much fresher, so wet and warm and damp with his salty, filthy foot sweat. Your cock hardens and throbs with need, but when you go to touch it, he slaps your hand away.</p>You sit obediently as Crook pulls off his other boot, and peels off his remaining sock. This one he pulls down over your throbbing cock, leaving the damp and wet fabric hanging from your manhood. Crook points to the older wolf who spoke earlier. \"Gramps, you've got big feet. Give me your socks\", he says. The old wolf scratches his beard, then shrugs. You see him reach down to his boots, which are cracked and dusty from many years of wear. He pulls them off, grunting and complaining as he does so, to reveal his paws are covered up by a pair of thick black socks. He rolls them down, showing off his grey-furred, rough and wide paws, before tossing them over. Crook pulls open one of the socks, and slides it over your muzzle. It's big enough to fit, but it's tight, and your breathing is now filtered through the warm well-used fabric. The older wolf's socks smell of nicotine, pipe smoke, and something like a sweaty, woody mature aroma. He slides the other sock over the first one with some difficulty, and you feel the fabric squeezing your face tightly.</p>\"Chip, yours\", Crook says. The scrawny wolf next to him spins on his barstool gleefully, and quickly tugs off his boots too. His are shorter, only up to his ankles rather than the half-calf boots the other wolves wear, and the socks underneath are yellowed with sweat. Despite his small paw size, his stink is powerful - even through the old wolf's socks you can smell the acrid, unwashed stench of sweaty musty old socks. Crook points to your bulge, and Chip happily rolls his socks down over the one already on your cock, forming a sort of round, tight fabric cage around your cock and balls.</p>Crook has more wolves step forward, and they add their socks to you too. A red-haired wolf covers your hands with his, and his scarred friend adds his own to make soft puppy-mitts for your hands. A tall, lanky wolf grumbles about the situation, but uses his socks as a rope to tie your wrists together. He shoves you to the ground under Crook's seat after doing so. Crook scratches his chin thoughtfully.</p>\"That bear who joined up last week. His feet were huge. Get him in here\", Crook says. Chip, now barefoot, hops down and runs outside, before returning with a towering behemoth of a man. It must have taken an entire cow to make the jacket the bear is wearing, and he has to crouch down slightly to avoid hitting the ceiling lanterns with his head. \"Gruff, I want your socks\", Crook says.</p>The bear blinks slowly, then looks down at you, bound and gagged on the floor. He walks closer, his massive boots pounding on the boards as he approaches you. With the tip of his steel-capped boot, he pokes your sock-covered bulge.</p>\"Fun\", he says. His voice is gravelly and has a slow drawl to it. He sits down, and pulls off his gigantic boots with some effort, revealing wide flat paws that are big enough to cover your entire chest. His socks are black, with the soles darker and damp with a sweat that smells oddly foresty, a sort of grassy, sweaty musk. He peels them off to reveal his sweat-glistening pawpads, then leans down and pulls you up. Without Crook asking, he takes one of the socks and pulls it up over your muzzle, then over your entire head, like a massive, sweaty balaclava. It's tight, and dark, and it gets tighter as he pulls the other one over it too. The darkness blacks out your vision, makes your hearing muffled, but surrounds you in thick, dirty paw stink.</p>You can't hold it in any longer. You grunt and moan through your gag, as you start to cum hands free. Your cock twitches and throbs, gushing sticky hot cum into the filthy socks, adding to the mess and dirt.</p>\"Alright, roll this foot slut under one of the benches. From now on this gang is mine\", Crook says. You hear the clink of glasses as someone kicks you over to a sticky, smelly nook of the bar. The party goes on as normal, everyone mostly ignoring the sock-bound, wriggling prisoner. Though the wolves who sit at the table where you are take a moment to ensure their feet are resting on your chest or sock-covered face.",

This familiar groove on your favourite barstool. The scent of smoke and unwashed wolf fur. Yeah, you've done this a thousand times before.</p>You stare at the bartender's ass and remember when he first showed up for the job. You thought it was a joke when he came in, a ram working at a pred bar, but when you tried to pin him and fuck him he ended up giving you the ride of your life. It impressed the crew and you ended up letting him stay. He sees you staring and gives you a grin.</p>You spin on your stool and down another one. Every gulp of that lovely brain-melting booze makes you feel more relaxed, and makes that nagging feeling in your head get quieter. Yeah, you're Borus. You've never been anyone else. This is your home.</p>When a fresh-faced greaser rat comes over and asks if he can rub your feet, you forget all about that weird feeling.

Despite being smooth and oddly refreshing, you feel a deep aroma of cologne and pipe smoke. There's a slight woody aftertaste, and what might even be spices and aged wine. It's very obviously a magical potion, and you steel yourself for what it's going to do to you.</p>Your skin starts to feel warm and tense, and you gasp and shudder. Every touch feels so sensitive that you find yourself stripping off your clothes and tossing them to the ground. As you do, the ram bartender slides a mirror over to you.</p>The first change you feel is a strange tense, firm feeling flowing throughout your body. Your stomach rumbles, and you reach down and feel your belly as it begins to bulge and inflate. You stare at it in surprise, seeing it slowly rising up, becoming bigger and rounder. The weight of it pulls down at your gut, like you've got a bunch of pillows strapped to you. The increased chub doesn't end there, either. Your arms become wider and heavier, getting pillowy and soft. You reach down under your gut and feel a soft pad of fat bulging out over your crotch, too.</p>Your skin tingles, feeling rougher and more dry. Your belly prickles as soft white hairs begin to grow all over it. They spread over your pecs in a swirl of fluffy white, and all the way down your belly as the fuzz becomes thick and wild. Your cheeks begin to itch, as more of the white hairs bristle and grow all over your chin, neck and lower face. They thicken and get more dense, rapidly becoming a beard that spreads all around your mouth and up to your sideburns.</p>Your other hair does not fare so well. You look in the mirror and see your hairline starting to recede, pulling up your head and leaving your forehead smooth and high. As it draws back, your head is left bald, and you stroke over your strange smooth new dome as you feel your remaining hair form a ring around the back. The colour in it fades, turning ashy grey, then snowy, soft white.</p>Your face starts to develop lines, starting with deep crinkles at the edges of your eyes. More wrinkles form on your forehead and down the side of your nose, and your body aches for a moment. You feel your shoulders get wider, as more white body hair forms on them too. Your back creaks and aches, making you taller, while your hands and feet stretch out and grow too. You look down at your thickening hands, the palms rough and firm from years of hard work. White hairs grow on the back, and form a thick dense covering all up your forearms.</p>Your beard starts to thicken more, becoming fluffy and soft. It grows out into a fluffy white cloud of hair, covering up your whole neck and reaching down above your chest. The hair on your upper lip grows even faster. It spreads out, fluffing up into a huge, bristling white moustache, that all but completely covers your mouth. The edges point up, the hair of your moustache and beard looking surprisingly well-maintained and dignified.</p>You stroke your hands curiously over your new body, feeling your bulging belly, stroking your fingers through your thick white body hair. Using the mirror, and pulling up your gut, you see that your cock has become fat and thick, and it hangs out freely from the fluffy bush of your pubic hair. The ram nods at you appreciatively.</p>\"Looking handsome, old man. I hear old humans like you are called 'polar bears', so you're welcome to drink at this bar like any other bear would be\", he says with a grin. One of the wolves chuckles, but the one who commented earlier is staring at you, his cheeks flushed red and his pants tenting. You give him a wink, and he looks away and smiles slightly. You feel an odd desire to show these young bucks a good time with a few big hugs and some time on your lap.",
