When you spark up your branding rod and start to rub it along the cow\'s mark, you worry that it will wake up and make a fuss, but surprisingly it only reacts by occasionally flicking its tail and shifting with annoyance. Before long you have a fairly convincing new brand set up on the cow\'s flank. You carefully wrap a long belt around the cow\'s thick neck, and slowly tug it out through towards the edge of the pasture. It\'s a nervous process, particularly when it loudly moos and cracks a thick twig under a hoof, but you manage to get it out and all the way across town towards your buyer\'s ranch.</p>The buyer, an enormous black bull with a distinctive scar over his muzzle, is very pleased to see you arrive. He\'s waiting on his porch, and leaps up with a snort when he sees you. He strokes his muscular hand over the cow\'s side and nods. "Great work kid. This will show that fucker Miller. He stole six of my herd last month!", he says with annoyance. He hands you a pouch full of bullets, and gives you a wink before you go. "Oh, and hey, if you ever want to join my herds you only need to ask", he says.',

It\'s deep in the night, and the moon gives everything a silvery, ethereal look. You climb through the wooden fence surrounding the pasture, and look around for a cow that isn\'t too close to the rest of them. You spy one with its back to you, and sneak over carefully. The brand is a little hard to locate on the flank of this particular huge dark-furred cow, but you eventually find it and start to push your brand against it, adjusting it slowly. There is a loud, angry snort, and the cow turns to look at you. That\'s when you notice that just under the flank, where you\'ve been branding it, there isn\'t an udder. There\'s a huge black bull cock. You look over to see the huge curving horns of the pasture\'s very angry, very territorial bull. He suddenly charges at you, his vicious curving horns barely missing you as the middle of his head rams you with bone-crushing force. You are knocked down, and his huge muscular body steps over you. Sweat drips onto you as you look up at his long, hard staff-like cock, and enormously pendulous glistening bull balls. He stamps a hoof, and snorts again, louder. The message is clear. Service, or be crushed.</p>You reach up and start to stroke and fondle the bull\'s massive balls. They\'re heavy in your hands, and they soak your fingers with sweat, the barnyard stink of his manly, dominant pheromones washing over your hands. You lean up and start to kiss them, licking along the firm skin and tasting the salty unwashed flavour of a powerful beasts\' crotch. He seems to approve, and so you keep it up. You lick between his balls, and along the back of them where it\'s hairier and even sweatier. The more you service him, the more you start to enjoy it. His stink is so dominant and powerful. His huge body above you is so strong, you want him to order you around and own you, like he is now. You press your face into his balls, letting them rest over you and feeling the warmth and scent of a powerful bovine male.</p>His sweat seems to almost soak into you, making you start to change. Your face pushes forward, growing wider and your nostrils flaring as you inhale more of the bull\'s aroma. Your forehead aches, as two hard nubs form and begin to curve up and stretch out. Your ears twitch and wriggle, sticking out from your head. You use your bigger, heavier head to kiss him more, licking up past his balls and along his huge black cock. Your hands and feet feel stiff and hard, as your fingers fuse together, toughening into a pair of hoof-hands. Your feet follow suit, becoming large cloven hooves. You feel a tail growing from behind you, sliding down and flicking as it forms a tuft. Splotched and spotted fur grows from your skin, white with black splotches, the perfect appearance for a big dumb cow. You moo loudly, and pull his cock down, desperate to feel it inside you, when suddenly you are yanked out from under him by powerful hands.</p>You look over to see a furious anthro bull, his fur white and his horns enormous. Your cow-instincts make you squirm and blush at the thickness of his muscles, his huge round gut, and that massive bulge in his pants. "The fuck are you doing in my pasture?! Get the hell outta here before I string you up, you trespassing asshole!", he yells. You blink as the partially-finished transformation fades, and suddenly come to your senses. You lumber away and flee, before you find yourself begging the rancher to turn you into his dumb feral breeding cow.',

Mirrors are hidden in various creative locations, there are arguments about who\'s marked deck should be used, and in one case a large snake just attempts to hypnotically convince everyone that his junk hand is actually the winner.</p>The one that finally gets you though comes from a huge, muscular possum. He\'s chewing tobacco when he walks into the poker den, and when he sits down, the other players have to scoot aside to make room. He grins at you with his long ratlike muzzle, and gives you a wink. At first, his tricks start off slow. He just leans back confidently, scratches his armpits and crotch, and belches loudly. His arrogant, crude behaviour is kind of distracting. During one hand, he loudly spits his nasty black tobacco into a pot, and then lifts his arms, showing off his extremely hairy grey pits. The two players next to him start to look dizzy and nervous. They fold the next hand, giving him the win.</p>After that he takes it a little further. When he leans back on his chair and puts his huge dirty pink feet on the table, everyone ends up staring at them. They\'re enormous, and filthy. They make you all feel nervous and shy and submissive. Fear flows through you, and you end up folding too. He takes that pot immediately.</p>Soon, no one else has many chips left. He grins, and picks at his teeth with one finger. "Tell you hwat, you folks can bet yer clothes insteada cash. Whatcha say?", he drawls in a deep rumbling voice. Everyone nervously nods, and the game continues. This time, he even loses a few hands, but when he pulls off his sweaty shirt to show off his big hairy round grey-furred gut, and drops his muddy pants to reveal the enormous bulge in his dirty underwear, everyone only gets more confused. Soon, the other players lose hand after hand. The cougar ends up fully naked first, then a ram, and the snakeman lasts longest. The possum places a dirty hand on his huge pile of chips and clothes. "Alright, one more round lads. Catboy, you bet yer fur. Sheep, I want them horns. Snake...how bout you bet yer whole body. An as fer you", he says, pointing at you, "I just wanna bit of free time from ye, hehehe", he finishes.</p>Somehow, you\'re all powerless to say no. At the start of the next hand, the possum stands up, and drops his underwear, revealing a massive uncut cock and thick, sweaty pubes. Everyone stares, entranced, not even looking at their cards. His hand isn\'t even worth anything, but when he claims that he won, you all just agree.</p>The cougar growls and squirms in shock. His fur is falling away, leaving his hands, tail and feet pink and naked. The rest of his fur becomes thinner and scruffier, becoming a dirty grey. The possum grins as his own fur starts to thicken and shimmer. It turns a deep, handsome bronze, and spreads down to cover his entire body, as a thick pelt of gorgeous cougar fur. The ram bleats and whines as his horns uncurl and shrink away, disappearing and leaving him looking like an immature lamb. The possum growls with pleasure as horns grow from under his thick new fur, stretching out and curling as they weigh heavily on his head, a crown of masculinity. The snake finds himself being dragged towards the possum\'s crotch, scrambling desperately as he tries to fight and pull away. The possum grabs his tail and lifts it, before taking his fat dirty cock and shoving it hard into the snake\'s rear. The snake hisses in alarm, and you can almost see his belly stretch to fit the possum\'s massive dick. The possum then beckons to you, and you find yourself walking over, like you\'re hypnotised.</p>You stroke your hands along the snake\'s belly and neck, massaging and teasing it. The snake coughs and shudders, his body getting longer and thinner. His tail begins to shrink, and his arms and legs get smaller and weaker. You stroke and rub those too, pushing them up into his torso, making him look more and more like a feral. As you rub up and down the snake\'s long body, the possum grunts and pants with pleasure. When the snake\'s limbs and tail completely shrink away, you see that the base of the possum\'s pink cock transitions smoothly into the snake\'s green flesh. He hisses and gasps, clearly trying to speak, but unable to. Finally, as you stroke and squeeze him, he spits up a huge mess of hot, thick white cum, which sprays from his mouth like he was spitting venom. His body feels weak and limp in your grip, and he gives you a desperate look before the possum grabs hold of his neck, and shoves him into his dirty pants as he gets dressed. "Thanks kindly for the presents, folks. Play again soon!", the hybrid-possum says with a chuckle, before walking out with his money, clothing, new fur and horns, and confused new snakedick.',

After days of asking around, you finally get a tip that there\'s a blacksmith a town over who takes on helpers in the night, on a hush-hush basis. It sounds extremely shady, but it\'s your best option, so you walk the long road down to the town and eventually find his workshop. It\'s a barn, with sheet metal on the roof and a hitching post set up on the outside. As you approach, you can hear the sound of loud hammering. You push open the heavy door and into the heat and light of the worshop. There\'s a roaring furnace in the corner, and benches and tools everywhere. At a large anvil, hammering away, is an enormous black ram. He finishes striking a glowing bar of iron he\'s working on, and plunges it into a trough next to him, sending up steam into the air. He looks over to you and grunts. "You the new worker?", he asks. You nod, and he scratches his rough, scruffy chin. His thick wooly fur is mostly around his shoulders and back, and at chest and legs his huge muscles are clearly visible. Unusually for a ram, he has large humanoid feet. He walks over to a table and picks up two peculiar horseshoes. They\'re massive, and the metal gleams in a strange way, with shifting colours like an oil slick. He hands them both to you. "Need you to put these on someone. Horse down the road, small house, next to saloon. Sneak off his shoes while he\'s asleep, put these on", he says. He also hands you a pair of pliers. You consider asking why, but his steely glare makes you decide to just do as you are told.</p>With the heavy horseshoes in your grip, you leave the forge and make your way down the road. It\'s far enough from the blacksmith that you\'re tired when you get there, but it\'s not hard to find the house in question in such a small town. You lever open one of the windows, climb up, and sneak in. The house is cluttered and messy, so you are very cautious when you make your way up the stairs and find the bedroom. The owner of the house, a brown horse with a large white splotch on his nose, is snoring loudly, and sleeping atop the covers of his bed. His feet are dangling over the edge of the bed, so you kneel down carefully and take a look at his shoes. The large iron curves are clearly nailed into his hooves, and you wonder how you\'re going to get them off, when your pliers begin to glow. You place them against the nails, and they slide free almost by magic. You almost don\'t catch the first horseshoe when it suddenly falls off, but fortunately your reflexes are well-honed. You repeat the process with his other hoof, then place the new horseshoes against his feet. The nails, still glowing, slide back in and fasten the shoes to his hooves.</p>Suddenly, the horse sits bolt upright, and you almost panic thinking that you\'ve been caught. Then you see that his eyes are still closed, and he\'s snoring. He stands up, walks downstairs, and opens the door. You follow him as he lurches slowly back up the road towards the blacksmith, who is waiting at the door with a grin. The big ram pulls the horse inside, and you sneak over to watch. Through the door, you see as the ram pushes the horse to his knees, sits on his anvil, and lifts up his huge, sweaty feet. The horse obediently opens his mouth and begins to lick along the ram\'s feet mindlessly. As his large tongue laps up the ram\'s sweat and licks between his toes, the blacksmith chuckles. "Think I didn\'t hear you talking about hoof superiority at the bar, Clyde? Well who\'s superior now, when you\'re under my feet and licking up my sweat? You\'ll be doing this every night, and wondering why you wake up with ram stink on your breath!", he growls.</p>The sleepwalking horse simply leans forward, holding the ram\'s feet in his hands and starting to suck on his muscular toes. The ram starts to stroke his cock, pumping it as he watches the horse servicing him. His thick black shaft oozes pre between his fingers, and he grunts and pants as he points it down towards the horse\'s muzzle, and sprays a thick jet of dripping cum all over his face. You quietly leave them to it, feeling flushed and aroused yourself too.',

You push open the heavy door and into the heat and light of the worshop. There\'s a roaring furnace in the corner, and benches and tools everywhere. At a large anvil, hammering away, is an enormous black ram. He finishes striking a glowing bar of iron he\'s working on, and plunges it into a trough next to him, sending up steam into the air. He looks over to you and grunts. "You the new worker?", he asks. You nod, and he scratches his rough, scruffy chin. His thick wooly fur is mostly around his shoulders and back, and at chest and legs his huge muscles are clearly visible. Unusually for a ram, he has large humanoid feet. He walks over to a table and picks up two peculiar horseshoes. They\'re massive, and the metal gleams in a strange way, with shifting colours like an oil slick. He hands them both to you. "Need you to put these on someone. Horse down the road, small house, next to saloon. Sneak off his shoes while he\'s asleep, put these on", he says. He also hands you a pair of pliers. You consider asking why, but his steely glare makes you decide to just do as you are told.</p>With the heavy horseshoes in your grip, you leave the forge and make your way down the road. It\'s far enough from the blacksmith that you\'re tired when you get there, but it\'s not hard to find the house in question in such a small town. You lever open one of the windows, climb up, and sneak in. The house is cluttered and messy, so you are very cautious when you make your way up the stairs and find the bedroom. The owner of the house, a brown horse with a large white splotch on his nose, is snoring loudly, and sleeping atop the covers of his bed.</p>His feet are dangling over the edge of the bed, so you kneel down carefully and take a look at his shoes. The large iron curves are clearly nailed into his hooves, and you wonder how you\'re going to get them off, when your pliers begin to glow. You place them against the nails, and they slide free almost by magic. You weren\'t expecting that, and your reactions are just a moment too slow. The horseshoe lands on the ground with a loud THUMP, and the horse snorts and sits up. "Who\'s there? Whassat?", he mutters sleepily. You quickly dash away, leaping through the window and escaping, though you\'re sure he got a glimpse of you.</p>You return to the ram with the bad news. He snorts and growls with frustration when you tell him you screwed up, and he grabs your wrist and pulls you into his forge. It\'s still incredibly hot inside, and his huge muscular body is dripping with sweat. "I wanted that horse to lick my feet clean. So since you fucked up, you\'re gonna have to do the job for him!", he snarls. </p>He shoves you down onto your knees, and sits down on the anvil. His huge feet are dark black, with strong muscular toes and curly wool-like hair on the tops. They are dripping with sweat, from the ram\'s time working hard labour in this hot forge. You reach forward and take hold of one, before starting to rub  and massage it. His musky, dominant scent washes over you, and he shoves his foot forward. "I said lick, not rub, you pansy", he growls. You gulp, and open your mouth. Slowly, you lick your tongue up his foot, his salty sweat dripping from the firm skin into your mouth. It\'s sticky and grimy, but it makes you shudder with a strange arousal and pleasure. When he rubs his other foot over your face, smearing you with his scent, you imagine that everyone will smell him on you, and know you have been under his feet.</p>You lick and kiss his soles, and rub your nose between his toes, before licking the hot, swampy spaces there, where the rough sweaty primal taste of him is strongest. You suck on his toes, making sure every inch is clean. The more you lick, the more you are falling in love with this ram\'s powerful feet, and doing it out of desire instead of fear. When you have tasted every inch of his huge black foot, you eagerly take the other one without being asked. While you are nuzzling and licking it, he snorts. "You make a terrible thief, but you might be a half decent foot slut", he grumbles. He reaches between his legs and starts to stroke his thick black cock, pumping and squeezing it as he watches you debase yourself with his sweaty feet. He grunts and closes his eyes, then unloads a thick, messy splatter of cum, that shoots out and sprays all over his feet. You immediately lift them up and start to lick the dripping, warm cum right off his soles. He grins with a little surprise at that. Once your mouth is filled with a mix of his salty sweat and sticky cum, he kicks you out, and shoves the forge door closed. You fantasise about his feet for hours before returning to normal.',

                        "text": 'Eventually your crimes were bound to catch up with you. You\'re looking for leads at a saloon one day, when a hand claps down hard on your shoulder. You turn to see a heavy set wolf, wearing a cowboy hat and a leather vest with a gleaming sheriff\'s star on it. "You\'re coming with me, outlaw", he says. He claps a pair of shackles around your hands, and you consider resisting until you see the gleaming pistol in his paw.</p>You get dragged out from the saloon and down to the sheriff\'s office, where the big wolf shoves you in a cell and locks you up while he writes up your crimes. The cell is just a tiny box with a barred window and two wooden bunks one atop the other. Once the sheriff has written you up, he tells you to stay put, puts his hat on, and heads outside.</p>You look around the station for anything you could use to escape. There\'s no obvious route. There\'s three cells, one of them only barely visible around the corner, and the other adjacent to your own. A coyote is sitting on the floor inside, his arms crossed behind his head. He\'s wearing only a pair of ratty, torn pants, and his fur is wild and dirty. The many scars that criss-cross his body, his filthy paws, and the tattoo across his back of a flaming skull, make it very obvious that he\'s probably not an upstanding member of society.</p>The coyote shakes his head, and leers at you through the bars. "Oof. Rough, kid. All that shit and you\'re probably lookin\' at months in the slammer! Maybe even getting transported to Hornloft!", he says. He chuckles a bit, then strokes his chin. "Tell you what, maybe me and you could do eachother a favour", he says. He points to a piece of paper on the wall. From here you can just about make out your name, with your crimes listed and a sentence of "three months" written next to them. Above your name is "Rex Coyote", charged with being drunk and disorderly, for a day in the cells. "That\'s me. About to get freed today. Still though, I might be willin\' to do a few months. I got these scars, see", he says, pointing to the pink slices across his chest and face. "That, an my fur fuckin\' stinks all the damn time. Dirty teeth, goin\' grey up top. I could do with a new body, is all I\'m sayin\'. How bout we swap, you go free, I get a nice new form?", he suggests. You consider it carefully. Months here in a strange prison could end any number of terrible ways, and you could probably transform yourself into something else once you go free. You hesitantly nod, and the coyote grins widely, showing off the two gold teeth in his long muzzle. "Great! Get a little closer", he says.</p>You press yourself against the bars, and the coyote reaches through, and holds onto your chest. His muzzle pushes against your face as he kisses you. His mouth tastes like tobacco, and his fur is sweaty and scruffy. He holds you tightly, not letting you get loose at all. You feel something strange happening. It feels like you have a flowing energy inside you, which is slowly bundling together, coagulating into a ball, and then sliding up your throat. The coyote presses his muzzle tighter over you, kissing you roughly, and the weird light fluffy feeling flows out of you and down his throat. You feel dizzy and light-headed for a moment, before a new sensation flows into you. Another ball of energy, but this one is dark, and dirty, and corrupted. It roils and twists, flowing down into you, replacing your previous energy, and spreading through your limbs. Your fingers twitch, and you find yourself panting and snarling. Your skin starts to itch and feel hot and uncomfortable. You scratch at yourself with fingers that are rapidly growing long, dirty claws. You pull your clothes off, sweating and panting as the heat flows over your skin. Thick brown fur starts to grow all over you, thicker around your neck, and lighter in shade on your chest. It flows up your face and down your limbs, your arms becoming a little longer, and hardening as they toughen with thin, hard muscle. Your hands stretch out wider, your palms forming dark pawpads, while your feet ache and stretch out. The bones creak and shift, becoming long strong paws, with dirty, rough pads on the bottom, and sharp claws. You clutch onto the bars of your cell, growling and panting, as a tail bursts free from behind you. It\'s scruffy and rough, the fur thick and wild, like you. Your face creaks and shifts, skull stretching out in front, forming your scruffy coyote muzzle. Your stomach growls as you feel hungry and on edge, and you become thinner and more malnourished, but with hard predatory muscles on your chest even though your ribs are visible.</p>There are suddenly several sharp, painful slashes across your body. You howl and call out, as your mind vividly recalls every fight, tussle and robbery that gave you each of those scars. They form pink lines all over your chest, and along your muzzle. You cough and spit, your long sharp teeth aching for a moment, as two fall out and are replaced by cold, hard gold. One of your eyes turns green, and the other a dirty brown, while your ears stretch up atop your head, one of them ragged and torn. You turn, your face twisted into a snarl that seems to come natural, and see the man in the other cell shifting and changing. His body is transforming into what yours was only moments ago. He reaches into your cell and grabs your clothes, pulling them on over his body even as he changes. He tosses his old, ragged pants into your cell, and you are suddenly distracted by the growing, throbbing bulge between your legs. You look down to see what must be the coyote\'s dick, a thick and heavy red rocket now rock-hard and belonging to you. You grip it, overwhelmed with sensations, and start to jack it off. Your dirty fingers squeeze your knot, and you feel dirtiness and criminality filling your mind. Memories that aren\'t your own, of robbing people, roughing them up, even killing. Doesn\'t matter to you, so long as you get something out of it. Your fur becomes matted and filthy from weeks without bathing, and you growl as you squeeze your knot hard, and spray thick, yellowed cum all over the floor.</p>There is a loud, sudden thump on the cage bars behind you. You turn to see the sheriff, looking at you with disgust. "Put your fucking clothes on, Spades. No one wants to see that shit", he says. Spades? Didn\'t the coyote say his name was Rex? You look over to him, and you don\'t like the evil grin on his face. The sheriff walks to the other cage, the one you can\'t see, and opens it. "Alright Rex, get out of here, and don\'t let me catch you drunk in the street again", he says. Another coyote walks out from the cage and stumbles out, grumbling. The sheriff tears the paper down off the wall, and you see another record below it, one from before he put up yours and Rex\'s. It says "Spades Shepherd. Ten counts of aggravated assault. Two counts of murder. One count of train robbery. Two counts of conspiracy. Life in prison: transport to Hornloft". You try desperately to tell the sheriff that there\'s been a mistake, but the voice that comes out of your mouth is coarse, and rough. You find yourself saying "Hey, copper. Fuck you", instead. The sheriff slams his baton on your cage, and you snarl. He opens the other cage, and pulls out the man in your former body. "As for you, since you\'re a newcomer, we\'re giving you one chance to go clean. Consider this probation", he says. Your old body winks at you before leaving the station, and leaving you trapped in his dirty, criminal body, taking the rap for his countless crimes.',

"In trouble again, as usual? I do say, I can\'t leave you alone for five minutes, can I?", he says. He waves a hand, and the roster of criminals resting on the sheriff\'s desk slides off and flies through the air towards him.

Can\'t imagine someone lasting weeks as my boots! Alright, here goes partner." he says. He reaches down to his belt and tugs on his silver flag belt buckle, loosening it and sliding down his leather pants. He was going commando beneath, and his shaft is already standing firm from the fuzzy sheath above his balls. The dusty brown of his fur turns to a soft cream on the underside of his tail and across his crotch and thighs. It makes for a bright contrast with his throbbing red cock.</p>He takes hold of you and presses his cock firmly to your crotch. You feel a strange heat flow through you, a vibration from the coyote\'s knotted shaft that fills you deep inside. There is a confusing sensation of familiarity and connection now, like an out of body experience. Your sense of self is no longer in your body, which feels a bit odd and wrong. Instead, you feel like your true self is there, between Ace\'s legs, heavy and throbbing and musky.</p>When Ace uses his gloved hands to turn you around and pull you close, you relax and let him move you. It feels natural to be in Ace\'s grip, to let him hold and adjust you. You only twitch or throb, not resisting when he presses his pointed canine cock against your rear. When his length slides into you and stretches you inside, it fills a gap inside you that you never knew you were missing. There is a connection, between your rear and Ace\'s crotch, a join where his body melds into yours. Except your body is just a part of his body. You belong to him.</p>Ace starts to slide his hands up and down your sides. Your skin is hot and flushed, feeling sensitive and starting to turn red, like an all-over blush. You shudder as you feel a pumping heat, a pounding from Ace\'s body into yours. His heart is now pumping blood into you, as your body submits to his, and becomes a part of him. </p>You were so distracted by the feelings and sensation that you had barely noticed your body shrinking and getting lighter. Ace is easily able to hold you up in both hands, and squeeze around you firmly. His touch is heavenly, every inch of your body as sensitive and pleasurable as your genitals. Your arms and legs are shrinking and weakening as you change, and before long they shrink down completely, before melting away into your torso and leaving you looking increasingly like nothing more than an extra-large coyote cock.</p>Your head starts to crane up, while your neck sinks into your torso and makes you unable to do anything but twitch and throb. You can taste salty, thick goo in your throat, and when your crotch starts to bulge and swell into a hard round knot, the goo oozes up and dribbles from your mouth. Your face melts away into the pointed red tip of Ace\'s new extra-large coyote sausage, and the cowboy canine pants and shudders as he teases your former chest with his thumb. "Fuck me, that always feels dang amazin\'. Now I just gotta get ya to Dormaus without blowin\' a load, else it\'s permanent.", he grunts. His fingers wrap around you completely, making you shudder and harden more in his grip. When he starts to pump you up and down, you know you should be concerned. You can\'t seem to care though, you just desperately want him to keep giving you that pleasure, that incredible sensitivity and lust. His hand grips around the rock-hard knot at your base, and the feeling of your knot being handled for the first time drives you over the edge. Your entire body is drowned in an overwhelming whiteout of pleasure. Every inch of you is burning with hot, pounding lust. Ace grunts and shudders, and you taste hot, thick cum rush up through your body, and spew from your mouth all over his furry cream-coloured chest. As you soften and shrink, feeling yourself drawn into his sheath, he mutters apologetically. "Shucks. Guess you\'re never leaving my crotch." he says. Darkness slides over you as you are covered by his warm and musky sheath. You feel yourself drifting off to sleep. </p></p>"Just fuckin\' with ya. I\'ll see ya in a few weeks." he chuckles.</p></p>For the next two weeks, your life is one of being in the dark sweaty warmth of your owner\'s sheath. You are awoken briefly to see the dusty western badlands so that Ace can unleash his hot, acrid piss through your body, and every night you feel yourself thicken and rise up from his sheath so that he can stroke and pump you to another mindblowing climax. Each time you unleash his cum, you become more addicted to the feeling, and you find yourself eagerly awaiting the next time your owner will give you that incredible sensation.',

His paw finally pulls free, almost popping out from the tight leather boot, along with a humid and steaming wave of stink. You can literally see musk rising from the opening of the boot, like steam in a sauna. The stench hits you like a fist, and you physically recoil.</p>It\'s like nothing you\'ve ever smelled before. A raunchy, nasty and dripping stink of pure man. You can smell every step Ace takes on his long adventures, feel the pounding heat beating down on him and the sweat dripping from his paws. Every smelly pair of socks, every hot and musky foot you\'ve ever smelled in your life, it\'s all tangled up and coming back to you, slammed into you with this intense and primal feeling. When Ace pulls off his other boot too, your knees buckle and you fall to the ground.</p>The coyote\'s paws are bare before you, and your mind is failing you. Your thoughts feel like a stuck record, unable to finish any complete sentences. It\'s so rank and nasty that you know you should be fleeing, but your body won\'t move. Instead you are just staring at the coyote\'s wide, long feet. Sweat is dripping down his soles, glistening as it moves. His pads are gritty and dusty with dirt, and his fur is matted and unwashed. When he wiggles his clawed toes, you whimper and gag on the stink of it. He gently sways his feet from side to side, and your vision follows it. "Yeah, you\'re on your way partner. Don\'t you worry none, my dogs have this effect on everyone.", he says, but you don\'t even hear it.</p>This stink is too much. Whatever you thought about paws and musk before, you can\'t handle it. But even so, you want more, like a strange addiction. Your trembling hands take hold of one of his steaming boots, and you press your face into the sweaty interior, and breathe in deep. At first, you gag and cough. Humid sweaty air is filling your mouth and lungs with a rank and salty taste. Then you take another breath, and another. You\'re drooling into the boot, your saliva adding to the slick sweat. Your vision blurs. You don\'t know when you drop the boot, but you know when your face presses into Ace\'s soles. You can feel his warm, gritty paws rubbing over your cheeks and face, soaking you in stink and dirt. You lick the dirt from his pads, from between his toes, and your mouth opens wide to slowly slide your entire face over the top of his paw.</p>You can feel his toes wiggling on your tongue, before his foot slides deeper and deeper inside you. It stretches and reforms you. Your skin feels tough and firm, as it starts to turn a shiny brown, and creak like leather. You feel his other foot teasing and stroking your crotch, before his toes stretch your hole. He pushes his paw into your ass, which opens up to accept it. You can feel him filling you from both sides, while your body comforms around his feet like shrink-wrap.</p>He starts to tug his feet apart, stretching you like taffy as he does. He grunts and tugs harder, until your body splits in two, painlessly. You feel him flexing his feet inside you, before he stands and his weight crushes down on you fully. You can feel your new soles in the dusty road. The sandy air blowing against your leather skin. The only thing you can focus on, however, is the filthy and sweaty taste of your new owner\'s feet, and the overwhelming stench of his manly musk.</p></p>The walk back to Dormaus takes weeks, like Ace said it would. You feel every step of it, your owner\'s body slamming down on you over and over. His feet making your insoles dark and nasty with dirt. His paws sweating into you, creating another humid swamp of stink in their leathery confines. He was also right about the brainwashing effects of the stink. After a few hours, when he prepares to camp for the night on the first day of his trip back, you can no longer remember ever wanting anything but feet. Sweaty, dirty, rank feet. They turn you on like nothing else. You sit on his paws all night, soaking in his sweat and dreaming of being trapped in this musky nightmare forever.</p>When he wakes up and walks off the next day, each step starts to drain your other memories. Your home town, your friends and life. All of it bleached out by the stink. At camp that night, he once again doesn\'t take you off, and you can barely focus on the memories of Dormaus, that you are an adventurer, though you do not know your name, or even what you used to look like.</p>It rains the day after that. Ace walks through squelching mud, and it soaks your soles and leaves sticky splatters all over your body. At one point he nearly loses half of you in a particularly deep and sticky puddle. When you camp that night, you only remember that you weren\'t always a boot. You used to be something else, once. You don\'t know how, or when, or why. Not even what you used to be. It could be a sock, for all you know.</p></p>Days pass, then a week. Ace is hiking up a mountain, and you are obediently protecting your owner\'s paws. Rocks and gravel are no problem for a well-made pair of boots like you. He pauses, panting, atop the mountain and looks to the distant green forest on the other side. "Almost home, partner. Anything left in there?", he says. You don\'t understand the words, or even the concept of what words are. You are boots. You are around paws. You are owned.',
