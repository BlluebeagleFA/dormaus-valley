                        "text": 'You place one hand on the side of the wagon, and pull yourself up. When you are halfway up, your king leans forward, places his powerful hands around your chest, and pulls you onto him as easily as he would lift a toy. His body is lying under you, his mighty chest a bed for you to rest your weary head and forget your old life. For a moment, you look back at the town of Dormaus, your life of adventure. Then your king stretches out one magnificent footpaw and adjusts the curtain, and your old life is out of sight.</p>Inside the canopy, your master\'s musk is all-pervasive. Every breath of air is filled with the scent of Him. You whimper helplessly as he holds your cheek in one mighty hand, and pulls you forward to kiss him. His powerful tongue slides around inside your mouth, his shaggy muzzle pressing against yours. You belong to him. He can do whatever he wishes to you.</p>You hear the workers finish loading up the wagons, and feel the rumble of the wheels as you start to travel. None of that matters though, the only rumble you care about is the beating of your king\'s mighty chest. He holds you and rolls you over, the other lionesses moving aside to allow the new slave to be taken and used. His weight presses down on you, as inescapable as the heat and musky, predator scent that is crushing at your mind. You arch your back and moan as his thick fur rubs against your chest, and his towering cock slides between your legs. He twists you around, and you feel his cock against your tender hole. The first thrust is slow, and careful. Inch by inch sliding into you, making you want to cry out for more, to beg to be filled. Your desires do not matter though. Only what your king wants is what matters, and he wants to take you slowly.</p>It feels like an eternity of need, your king\'s throbbing shaft sliding against your stretched insides just fast enough that you shiver and whimper. Finally, he fills you, his cock deep inside you, his balls pressed against your ass. Inside, you are exactly the right size for him. Your body is made to serve him. He pants and growls above you, his handsome face twisted into a lusty grimace, before he pulls back, and rams forward hard. Again, and again. Harder and faster, the wagon rocking with the force of his thrusts as he slams his cock against your insides. As his motions speed up, so too does his ragged breathing, until he grips your body painfully tight in his clawed hands, and his slavering maw bites down at your shoulder. His fangs press against your skin, not penetrating, but making you know you are mounted, you are owned. </p>You feel his cock pulse and throb, before ropes of hot cum splatter and gush inside you. His hips thrust and rock as he climaxes, filling you up with his fertile seed. When the last of it oozes out into you, he pulls out, and strokes your chest as a lioness moves over to lick him clean. "Another beautiful toy for my harem", he says with a chuckle, before turning to kiss a different lioness and starting to grope her.</p>As you lie panting in bliss, your king moves on to fucking one of the lionesses. You are compelled to nuzzle and rub against him while he takes his pleasure from her. After hours of play, you all snuggle up together at the sides of your king, and settle in to sleep.</p></p>In the morning, you are woken by your king licking and nuzzling your neck, while stroking your breasts in one of his mighty hands. These experiences continue for days. Your king uses every part of you, his cock fills your mouth, your tailhole, everywhere, and his groping hands experience every touch of your skin. When he is not using you, he is pleasuring himself with one  of the lionesses, and you are commanded to kiss his feet or rub his mighty fur. Days pass, travelling in the wagon, and meals are brought to you by the muscular and sweaty lion workers, who gaze at you lustfully. After a few weeks of service, the wagons come to a stop, but you do not leave your master\'s side. The entire canopy-covered section of the wagon is lifted up and carried away, so you never see what is happening outside. You do not need to know that. You are too busy with your muzzle around your king\'s shaft, as he slams his cock deep into your face. The days after that are colder, and take place with swaying and rocking motions. If you were not so distracted by servitude, you would realise you were on a boat.</p></p>Over the following months, the king sometimes leaves his plush cushion-filled cabin. When he does, you are commanded to wait for him, and the lack of his presence fills you with a desperate need to have him back. Your life as an independant adventurer is like a distant dream. Such a long time has passed with your mind washed clean by hypnotic musk, that you have lost all willpower and free thought. Each time your king returns, your thoughts disappear and you are overcome with love and obedience once more.</p></p>The weather begins to warm up, over time, and one day you awaken to find your king is not with you. The cabin is no longer rocking and swaying, and the lack of motion is disorienting after months at sea. You wait loyally for your owner to return, but instead, the curtains part to reveal tall and dirty lion workers. They round up you and the other harem slaves, and place beautiful silver chains on your collars. One of them gives a firm tug on your chains, and you follow him meekly out into the sunlight, for the first time in months.</p></p>The sun is bright and the very air around you is sizzling hot. Your lioness body seems to respond to the heat, and you feel a strange sense of belonging. When your eyes adjust, you see that you are walking down the gangplank into a strange new city. The roads are pounded sand, and the buildings are yellow brick and stone, in the shape of step pyramids. You are led forward through the streets, which are flanked with tall palm trees and wandering people of all races. Most common, though, are the lions. Some on two legs, some on four, and some with four legs but another torso above it, like a leonine centaur. None pay any mind to the procession of naked lionesses on chains. You are led to the tallest and most magnificent ziggurat, the tip of which gleams bronze in the sunlight. You climb many sandy stone steps, until you are high above the city, and from there you can see far into the distance.</p>This new city is large, and busy, completely dwarfing the little town of Dormaus. Surrounding it, as far as the eye can see, are dusty plains, flat and hot. You take it all in, before you are guided into the pyramid. You walk through hallways inlaid with gold and ivory, with so many twists and turns that you are quite lost. Finally, you are led into a wide open room, with a tinkling fountain in the center, and blankets and cushions strewn about. A huge balcony looks down over the city, and you and the other harem slaves are left here as the workers depart.</p>Your life now is one of a harem slave, pampered but trapped in a gilded cage.',

Your palms are tingly and you can\'t seem to resist Flute\'s actions. Was there something in that package? It doesn\'t matter, the only package you can seem to care about is the enormous one between the legs of this handsome fox. </p>Your mouth opens as Flute thrusts forward, sliding his cock over your tongue and deep into your throat. He thrusts in and out, grinning and breathing heavily while your nose bounces against the pale orange fur of his pubes. His clawed hands grip harder on your head as he shudders and moans. </p>You feel his cock pulse, before thick, hot cum floods your mouth. You swallow every drop of his salty fluids, as it is pumped into you in thick and heavy spurts. Flute then pulls out, leaving you craving more. He pulls his pants off, gives you a wink, and leaves. A little while later, you finally recover your senses and manage to get up off the ground.',

You can see candles burning in the windows of houses preparing for Red Night, and the bright flickering glow of Flute's bonfire.</p>\"What do you see, when you look down there?\", he asks. You cannot see his eyes well beneath the wide brim of his hat, but you can feel somehow that his gaze must be distant. \"Lights, and excitement, I'm sure. For the old, it is different. You can see leaves blow and tumble in the wind, and see what is there. When you are old, every sight brings an echo of another from the past. Years ago, seeing the same thing, with different people, in different times. Becoming deeper and more occluded with each year. And I am so very, very old\", he says.</p>He shifts his leg, and reaches down to lift up the lantern. Its light flickers for a moment as he raises it. It is made of paper, delicately stretched over a wooden frame. There are paintings on the sides, that leave silhouettes as the light within glows.</p>\"The lights from here remind me of a place I loved once, long ago. It was a beautiful city, yet afflicted with almost eternal twilight. The people of the city would light their lives instead with lanterns, and with the tales they told and the memories of friends and family. Each lantern bore the meaning and emotions of its creator, and once a year they would give new lanterns to the ones they loved to light eachother's lives a little more\", he says. He stares down at his lantern, his long fingers tracing delicately over the little painted symbols on the sides. There is a long period of silence. Eventually, you ask him what happened to that city. The lantern light flickers again, then grows bright as it becomes a deep, burning red. In the darkness, the red light for an instant seems to make Mr Bat's black clothes look deep crimson, and for just a moment you feel he looks like something terrible, and dangerous.</p>Then, as quickly as it happened, the light is normal again.</p>\"It was taken by time, as all things are in the end. I did not see it with these eyes, and these feet never walked its streets. But I remember it still\", he says.</p>You sit together with him for a while more, watching the town below. His wings flex slightly, and he lifts one. The long cape-like skin drapes gently over your back. You feel sleepy, and rest yourself gently against his side. Over time, the lantern's light slowly dims and goes out.</p>You awaken the next morning, roused by the rising sun. Mr Bat is nowhere to be seen, but the lantern is sitting in the grass next to you. You sit up and take it gently, before making your way back down into town.",

He adjusts his belt, then pulls down his chaps and trousers to pull out a thick and dark-coloured cock with a thick sheath. </p>He sighs as he relieves himself with a stream of steaming piss on the tree\'s roots, then when he is done, grabs his cock and starts to stroke it. He grunts and pants, grinding his boot into the dirt as he jerks off. His furry muzzle hangs open, and he shudders with relief, his cock jerking and spurting strange, sticky green cum that splatters over the tree and glows faintly. Huge amounts of it stream and spurt from his cock, until half the tree is coated in slime. He sees you watching and chuckles. </p>"When bullets don\'t work, I got a few other tricks to get folks outta my way." he says. He winks at you, pulls his pants back up, and heads towards the bar.',
