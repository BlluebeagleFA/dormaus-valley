The two of you are starting to get tired, and your hands and feet are covered in mud from where you've been bounding along beside him on all fours. He stops besides a large rock in the road, and stretches out.</p>You sit down obediently, watching as he turns his arms to the side and presses down on his shoulders, then squats and stretches out his legs. He lifts his arms up high, stretching his back, and then finally takes a seat on the mossy rock. \"Nothing exciting today it seems, pup\", he says. You cock your head to the side, not understanding Master's noises, as usual.</p>What you are more interested in is his large, furry grey paws. You step forward and press your nose against them, sniffing the scent of your Master's thick, strong musk, along with the earthy and grassy smells of all the places you've been today. Master lifts his paw, allowing you to rub your nose against the damp grey fur on his sole, and along the thick bulging black pads on each of his toes and at the top of his sole.</p>You shiver with pleasure, your mind feeling even more simple and content as you breathe in deeply. The collar around your neck feels warm, as if it's wrapping around your mind and keeping you safe and simple.</p>You bark and wriggle with glee, before starting to slowly lick at your master's paws, tasting the sweat that slowly drips down his pawpads. He leans down, pressing his toes over your face as he pets and ruffles your hair. \"Damn but you are cute. I wonder if I looked like that with the collar on? I'm almost jealous\", he mutters. You just happily continue to serve his feet until it is time to move on.",
