He nudges it sideways until it is bobbing against the side of the riverbank. \"Hop on, cuz!\", he says. You carefully step onto the crate, feeling it bounce and sink a little in the water, before you manage to clamber aboard.</p>Robbie continues pushing the crate, which gradually returns to the middle of the river as he floats it down. \"So, you been up to any exciting adventures lately?\", he asks. You start to tell Robbie about what you've been doing recently, but while you talk, his whiskered face seems to hover around your feet. He reaches up and starts to pull off your shoes and socks, then strokes his padded hands over your bare soles. You look down at him as he pulls your bare feet into the water, and he gives you an innocent smile. \"Go on! I'm totally listening, cuz. Just thought you might enjoy the water!\"</p>You poke the otter on his muzzle with your dripping wet foot, and carry on talking while he nuzzles his tickly, whiskered muzzle over your sole. He pulls your feet under the water again, and you feel your soles growing tough and firm under his touches and strokes. A strange feeling spreads up between your toes, and you pull your feet back out, to see dark black webbing between your toes, even as your toenails sharpen and stretch out into small black claws. Robbie's eyes twinkle as he licks your new webs, and you feel a tingly, warm sensation flow up your skin from your feet upwards. Soft, smooth brown fur begins to grow over your new paws, up your legs and gradually up to the rest of your body. He grips your paw in one of his clawed hands and squeezes your toe. \"You know, the water feels pretty good today. I bet this delivery would go even faster with two people pushing\", he says.</p></p>The otter may be cute, but he's not subtle. You pull your shirt up over your head, and shuffle out of your pants before leaving them both folded atop the crate. Robbie whistles appreciatively at your naked body, and you give him a playful shove on his head with your foot. He responds by sinking down in the water, then lunging up, wrapping his furry arms around your chest, and falling back as he drags you into the water with him. You feel the water surge up around your body, as the smooth sleek fur of your changing form spreads up your chest and arms. Robbie's hands stroke down your back and squeeze your rear, and you feel your tailbone shifting and growing. It stretches out, thickening with muscle and strength as it becomes a strong, sleek rudder tail just like his.</p>His whiskered face presses to yours, and you feel his cold nose poking against your own as he starts to kiss you. His tongue slides against your own, and you feel his sharp, short teeth against your tongue as you twirl and twist under the water.</p>You flex your tail, and push yourself up to the river's surface. You feel yourself breach, sending water twinkling and splashing through the air. Robbie rises up in front of you, and pins you against the crate, his arms at your sides. You kiss him first this time, feeling your face stretching into a streamlined furry muzzle, your own sharp otter teeth growing in, and your own sensitive whiskers sprouting from your cheeks. His slender furry chest presses against your own, and you nuzzle and cuddle with him as the last of your changes settle in.</p>Once you feel yourself fully returned to your otter shape, you give Robbie a playful lick, and then duck down under his arms, before emerging next to him. With both of you pushing and flexing your powerful tails, the crate speeds along the river at a rapid pace. Robbie has such a wide grin and cheerful look that you find yourself compelled to ask why he always wants to turn you into an otter. He looks surprised for a moment, then glances away as he thinks. \"Oh! I'm not sure, really. I guess I just always thought it would be nice to have, like...a family, I guess?\", he says. You wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't spent so much time around him, but just for a moment his happy look faltered very slightly. You switch the conversation to more cheerful topics instead, and the two of you reach Otterton in what feels like no time at all.",

The otter\'s eyes are swirling and spinning with colours, as he climbs into the boat and drops the fish at the human\'s feet. The human then swishes his multicoloured pole, and the otter dives back into the water to fetch him more. It looks like the pole is magic, and is hypnotising the otter into serving the fisher\'s desires.</p></p>However, there seems to be a catch with the magic. With every extra fish his otter slave brings him, the human starts to change. He kicks off his boots, and flexes his toes as they form dark webs between them. Sleek brown fur starts to grow all over his body, and he pushes down his pants, not seeming to notice the long thick rudder tail forming from his rear. Whiskers sprout from his face, and his ears become round and furry. When the otter returns to add another fish to the pile, the fisherman\'s own eyes start to glow and swirl, and he dives into the water, before nuzzling and kissing his former slave. The two of them swim away, with the fisherman leaving his boat, his pole, and his life behind.',

You see him reach into the water and pull out an enormous trout, with gleaming, glittering golden scales. As the fish wriggles and thrashes in his hands, it speaks aloud. "Please free me sir, and I will grant you any one wish!", it cries. The fisherman grins widely. "I got you at last, magic fish! I wish for the perfect lover who will satisfy all my needs!", he replies. </p></p>He then tosses the fish back, and rubs his hands eagerly. But as soon as the fish hits the water, the fisherman starts to change. His hands get thinner, and spread out into fins, while his skin starts to shine and glimmer. It cracks into scales, each golden and shiny, and he starts to gasp for air. He struggles into the water, his clothing falling off as his legs fuse together, with his feet turning into another fin. Finally he struggles free of his clothes and splashes into the water, as his body shrinks and transforms into a strong, streamlined golden trout. He bubbles with confusion in the river, until the other fish returns, and rubs against him. The two of them swim off, with the former human\'s eyes slowly turning dark and fishlike as he swims. It seems that someone certainly got their perfect lover.',
