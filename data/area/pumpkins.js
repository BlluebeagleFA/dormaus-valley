                        "text": 'You stop for a moment to admire the patch of enormous orange pumpkins that is growing all over this patchy grassy area of land. The round orange vegetables are scattered here and there, in all sorts of sizes, their thick vines criss-crossing the ground, and their bulging orange forms making a colourful contrast to the browns and greens of the soil and grass. In fact, there are so many that it almost seems like more are appearing, or moving around, whenever you look away. </p>You lean down to admire a particularly large one, and when you stand up and turn around, two more are at your feet, where you are sure there was a path just moments before. You take a step back, and your foot catches on one of the thick green vines, causing you to fall backwards and land in the grass, with pumpkins surrounding you on all sides. When you try to push yourself back up, you find your arms are tangled up in curling leafy vines, and you struggle to pull them free. </p>It is then that you feel your legs slowly being pulled open, and you manage to lean up enough to see the pumpkin vines slowly curling around your legs! They are moving, and alive! The vines send tendrils slowly up along your legs, curling around your thighs and squeezing you firmly, while more of them hold your arms down and then start to wrap around your torso. One huge, throbbing green vine snakes up past your chin, dripping with green fluid. It presses against your mouth, forcing it open as it pushes its way across your tongue and into your throat. </p>The strange, musky goo makes you feel lightheaded and strange. Your body throbs and pulses with pleasure, and you feel your muscles relaxing. You barely resist as another identical vine slides along your ass, teases your hole, and then pushes its way inside. The bulging vine stretches your insides and pumps in and out of you, and it feels incredible. </p>The vines hold you tight, thrusting and throbbing in your rear, and all the while they fill your mouth with that wonderful, intoxicating goo. Your resistance is crumbling away. This feels too good. Too incredible. You want more, you can\'t possibly imagine giving up this amazing sensation. You just go limp and revel in it, and the vines seem to recognise your submission. The one in your mouth pulses and fills you with even more wonderful warm goo, while the one in your rear slides deeper and deeper, filling you in a deep, hot part of yourself you never knew existed. </p>Your skin begins to feel stiff, swollen and strange. The colour of it changes, flushing with something odd as it takes on a shiny, orange tint. Your belly bulges and swells, inflating like a balloon, while the rest of you seems to draw inwards, shrinking and pressing into your expanding gut. Your arms and legs slide free of the tangling vines, only to press into your orange belly and melt away. Your head sinks down into your torso, and your flesh becomes hard and firm as it forms vertical ridges all along your huge round belly. </p>The pleasure becomes all you know, and all you can comprehend. Your vision and other senses fade as your face melts away into your belly, leaving only the thick vine sticking out from where your head once was. The rest of you is nothing more than a huge orange vegetable, a simple pumpkin in a patch of many other simple plants. No one would know that within this handsome pumpkin is a mind lost forever in endless pleasure.',

You feel the sole of his paw as he strokes it slowly along your firm rind. Smears of wet pumpkin drip along your bulbous body, the remains of former humans, turned into pumpkins and then into crushed goo by this powerful cat. </p>His claws slowly emerge, and trace along your body. It\'s ticklish, and you would squirm if you could, as he leaves thin lines cut into your side. His paw lifts high into the air, and you are sure that this is the end. You will soon be just a messy pile of goop for his amusement. But then he lowers it again, and winks at you. "Perhaps once you are a little larger, my friend", he says, and walks off to his next victim.',

It\'s Grizz, the barkeeper. </p>You watch as he pulls his cock out from under his apron, and begins to pump and squeeze the thick, dark meat of his swollen bear cock. His foreskin slides up and down his glistening shaft, until he grunts and growls. With a pant, and a jerk of his cock, a messy splatter of cum slaps against your orange pumpkin body.
