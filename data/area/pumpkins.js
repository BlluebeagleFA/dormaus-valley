                        "text": 'You stop for a moment to admire the patch of enormous orange pumpkins that is growing all over this patchy grassy area of land. The round orange vegetables are scattered here and there, in all sorts of sizes, their thick vines criss-crossing the ground, and their bulging orange forms making a colourful contrast to the browns and greens of the soil and grass. In fact, there are so many that it almost seems like more are appearing, or moving around, whenever you look away. </p>You lean down to admire a particularly large one, and when you stand up and turn around, two more are at your feet, where you are sure there was a path just moments before. You take a step back, and your foot catches on one of the thick green vines, causing you to fall backwards and land in the grass, with pumpkins surrounding you on all sides. When you try to push yourself back up, you find your arms are tangled up in curling leafy vines, and you struggle to pull them free. </p>It is then that you feel your legs slowly being pulled open, and you manage to lean up enough to see the pumpkin vines slowly curling around your legs! They are moving, and alive! The vines send tendrils slowly up along your legs, curling around your thighs and squeezing you firmly, while more of them hold your arms down and then start to wrap around your torso. One huge, throbbing green vine snakes up past your chin, dripping with green fluid. It presses against your mouth, forcing it open as it pushes its way across your tongue and into your throat. </p>The strange, musky goo makes you feel lightheaded and strange. Your body throbs and pulses with pleasure, and you feel your muscles relaxing. You barely resist as another identical vine slides along your ass, teases your hole, and then pushes its way inside. The bulging vine stretches your insides and pumps in and out of you, and it feels incredible. </p>The vines hold you tight, thrusting and throbbing in your rear, and all the while they fill your mouth with that wonderful, intoxicating goo. Your resistance is crumbling away. This feels too good. Too incredible. You want more, you can\'t possibly imagine giving up this amazing sensation. You just go limp and revel in it, and the vines seem to recognise your submission. The one in your mouth pulses and fills you with even more wonderful warm goo, while the one in your rear slides deeper and deeper, filling you in a deep, hot part of yourself you never knew existed. </p>Your skin begins to feel stiff, swollen and strange. The colour of it changes, flushing with something odd as it takes on a shiny, orange tint. Your belly bulges and swells, inflating like a balloon, while the rest of you seems to draw inwards, shrinking and pressing into your expanding gut. Your arms and legs slide free of the tangling vines, only to press into your orange belly and melt away. Your head sinks down into your torso, and your flesh becomes hard and firm as it forms vertical ridges all along your huge round belly. </p>The pleasure becomes all you know, and all you can comprehend. Your vision and other senses fade as your face melts away into your belly, leaving only the thick vine sticking out from where your head once was. The rest of you is nothing more than a huge orange vegetable, a simple pumpkin in a patch of many other simple plants. No one would know that within this handsome pumpkin is a mind lost forever in endless pleasure.',

"Perhaps once you are a little larger, my friend", he says, and walks off to his next victim.',

You pull yourself to the top, and look down into the inside of the thing that will soon be digesting you. While the outside is shiny, firm and green, the top of the plant flares out to show off an opening that is wet, pink and slimy. It glistens with slippery goo, and when you gently touch it, the cold slime is thin and very slick. This is your last chance to turn back and stop this foolish idea. Instead of doing that though, you pull yourself up, and dangle your legs down the inside of the plant. At the bottom, where the base bulges out, there is a slick pool of slime, which you will soon be adding to. You hold the edges and drop down, your back sliding down the wet and slippery inside of the plant, and then you land with a messy splash in the thick, sticky slime in the middle of the flower.</p>You slowly sink in the goo, your legs being pulled down into the thick digestive plant juices. You are pulled down to your chest, only your arms and head sticking up out of the fluids. Experimentally, you try pulling on the sides of the wall, but they are slimy and frictionless. Escape is impossible. Nothing to do but lie back and accept your fate as plant food. You move your legs slowly in the goo, feeling a tingling growing in them. They feel weak and limp, the tingling growing to an intense pins and needles, and then you can no longer feel them at all. You scoop up some of the digestive slime and rub it on your chest and face, feeling it tingle and fizz against your skin. Your body is tingling and flushed under the slime, with your arousal at knowing you are literally digesting right now. You reach down and slowly stroke yourself, fondling and masturbating with the thick, cool slimy goo, until you feel your fingers squish through your crotch as it falls apart and melts into more slime. You try to pull your hands back up, but they go numb and melt away. You feel your torso sinking down further, your skin glistening and gleaming as it turns green and goopy. You look up at the sky through the top hole of your predatory flower, and relax as you let yourself sink down into goo, your body and head melting away as your mind and thoughts sink into calm, slimy darkness.',
