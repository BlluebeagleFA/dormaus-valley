You feel like you could wander through the desert like this forever. Like this is where you were meant to be. You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you.

As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

You feel like you could wander through the desert like this forever. Like this is where you were meant to be. You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you.

As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

Finally, the features on your head fade over, your whole body becoming a lump of messy, weathered stone, indistinguishable from any other normal boulder in the desert.</p></p>The sandstorm slowly fades, and the rocky creature's eyes seem brighter and more alert.

You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you. Why do you even need clothes? You are better off without them.</p></p>You pull off your shirt and pants, tossing aside your protection from the sun. As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

You feel like you could wander through the desert like this forever. Like this is where you were meant to be. You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you. Why do you even need clothes? You are better off without them.</p></p>You pull off your shirt and pants, tossing aside your protection from the sun. As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

You cling to his neck for dear life, until after what seems a suspiciously short time, he stops.</p></p>You open your eyes, and realise you're back at Honest Even's shop. That can't be right - barely any time passed at all. You look suspiciously at your saurus, but he's already rooting in your pack for a treat. It can't be magic, surely?
