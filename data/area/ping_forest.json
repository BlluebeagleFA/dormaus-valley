However, there is not a single soul in sight despite the voices and music, instead the grounds look empty and abandoned despite the clear signs that a party of some kind is being held here. You are about to take a step forward, until you notice right below your foot, and lining the camp in a perfect circle, lies glowing blue mushrooms, radiating what seem to be little wisps of light that rise barely a few inches before dissipating into nothing.

No matter how far you run you can not shake the feeling that he is directly behind you, the howls and barks of his dogs confirming it, their noise never seeming to get farther away. You franticly try and think of some way to lose them and maybe get some rest from the continuous running. </p>\tYou continue to run until you spot what looks like a tiny waterfall that runs into a creek. You find that all the running has made you parched and tired, the endless fear of being caught being the only thing that spurs you forward being the instinctual fear of what could happen to you if you are caught. You quickly ponder whether or not it would be a good idea to stop for a drink, and then decide that you can't keep running like this without something giving out. </p>\tYou stop at the edge of the creek, bending down to get a few quick gulps of the water. The water itself appears to be quite clean and clear; tasting it, it has a slight metallic taste and goes down quite easily. You find yourself drinking more of it, the water somehow hitting just the right spot. You eventually stop, remembering the danger you are in, and as you do you realize that almost all of your fatigue had faded away. You’d feel great if you didn’t feel a knot of fear and despair form in the pit of your stomach as a single hound popped out of the trees.</p>\tIt looks at you and it smiles a wide toothy grin; the shape of red thorns in place of teeth giving off a menacing presence. You don’t hear the rest of the hounds, this one being one of the vanguards that split off to follow your scent more directly. You quickly turn away from it to run, and hopefully avoid the beastly creature, but instead it pounces quickly, pinning you to the ground. Its “teeth” right against the back of your neck, the wood-like fangs touching just against your hide. </p>\tYou then feel its fangs slightly press down onto your flesh, just breaking the skin and drawing blood, and then suddenly back away. You hear a deep brittle laugh behind you, the chortle of the creature sounding close to wood rubbing together added to something you can place, the sound unsettling you and making you want to run away more. The bramble hound continues to laugh as it keeps its prey pinned and then it stops laughing, a snarl in its voice as it gets tired of your struggling.</p>\tIt snaps its right near you neck, the noise and feeling loud enough to freeze you in place. You then feel its weight shift on top of you, normally you’d try and look to see what it is doing but the fear of pain overwrites any curiosity you may have. However, the realization of what he’s doing comes in full force when you feel a slick thing prod against your rear. Its member making you think of an oiled-up jumble of vines. </p>Whatever it is, you can feel it roughly trying open your hole and use you for its own pleasure. It rubs against it with no regards for your comfort, thrusting along it. As it rubs, you can feel it seemingly grow more and more, the twists of the coiled vines seemingly getting larger and tighter until finally he is done teasing his cock. With a single crackling growl, he thrusts his way inside, causing you grit your teeth hard.</p>The feeling of it entering you with little lubrication causes a great amount of discomfort despite the unusual waves of pleasure coursing through your body. With this mixed discomfort you realize that struggling right now is useless. You must wait. Bide your time. Find that exact moment in which you can escape. Instead of losing yourself to the pleasure or pain, your mind and body are calm for once, contrasting the near wild plant beast on top of you.</p>And so, you wait, letting the thing on top of you continue to rut itself within you. You then feel the vines seemingly get tense and tighter, a slight pulse rippling around it and within you. You realize that this means he is getting close his climax, whatever that means for you. It is then with a large howl, you feel one final pulse, and then a gush of warm sap like liquid, the orange material feeling sticky and warm in your rear. However, that is when his grip loosens, and you take the chance that was given to you.</p>You instantly buck within its loosened grip, barely breaking free with only negligible scratches. The surprised creature has no time to react before you are back to running in the forest. And so, everything is back to how it was, with the hunters still chasing you down, albeit now with an uncomfortable, sticky feeling in your bum as you run.",

Before you can stand up the hounds break through the tree line and see you. The pack surrounds you quickly in a circle, trapping you. You get up and try to see if there is any breaks you could dash through to escape but more and more of the bramble hounds appear, plugging up any route to freedom, the circle slowly shrinking as they snap at you. A single loud whistle fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, stopping their approach before they could tear you apart.</p>\tYou see the chariot, and the hunter that stood upon it, his plant-like visage in the shape of a snarl, his vines practically snapping like whips in the air. He speaks, the anger in his voice quickly apparent and setting your instincts on fire, making you want to escape anywhere, anywhere but here. “You have disappointed me. I had such high hopes that this hunt could be entertaining but you botched it. A pathetic prey such as you doesn’t even deserve to be released back into the population.” </p>Instantly one of those vines snap towards you, wrapping around your throat, the barbs digging into your flesh as it drags you into the air, choking you. You thrash and fight, body gasping for any air as you are lifted towards your aggressor. His maw opens, revealing an almost plant like interior. A sweet-smelling wafting towards your nose, one that would be almost calming if you were not choking to death. And then as quickly as he grabbed you, he drops you inside. His maw closes, ending both the light and your hopes for survival, leaving you in a chamber of sweet-smelling nectar.",

Yet they seem to not be hostile instead sitting down, already somewhat understanding your intentions. The chariot breaks through the line of trees and stops behind the circle, the Hunter staring down at you. Despite your instincts yelling at you to run and flee, you look at him with an almost pleading face. He smiles an unexpectantly warm smile, and wordlessly approaches you. Something about the air seems different with that thorny smile, less fearful, sweet smelling, comfortable.</p>\tHe then speaks, his voice somehow calming, “You have given a satisfactory chase my little prey, it is time for your reward.” One of his vines approaches you and lightly rubs against the side of your muzzle, the thorns not scratching you, instead releasing a sticky yellow sap like substance that smears into your fur. You don’t quite know why but you open your mouth and the vine slowly snakes its way inside. The sap tastes overwhelmingly sweet, as if it was pure sugar. You shudder feeling somewhat strange and different, looking up at the Hunter, or rather the Master.</p>\tThe new name appears in your head immediately. It feels natural. Relaxing. And so, you relax even more and begin to suckle on the vine almost instinctually, the reward being more spurts of that sweet sap. It doesn’t take long for you to feel somewhat strange, your fur itching and feeling very unnatural, almost like an itchy sweater. You start to scratch at it with your front hooves, or rather your front claws. You were so caught up with the vine, you didn’t see when your front feet changed. Instead of hooves, strange leafy paws are there, the ends tipped with wooden claws that scratch your odd itch just right.</p>\tAs you continue to suckle upon that vine the changes that started with your paws begin to spread, painless thorns poking out from your white fur, a green over taking as the fur of your legs begin to recede. They become skinnier, yet somehow stronger and tighter as they start to resemble the stems of roses wrapped around one another. With one paw you start to hang upon that vine, and the Master gives an approving smile as he stares at his newest thrall slowly and willingly lose their past identity. </p>\tYour white-furred flesh gives way to the greens and browns as the changes spread further, red spiky thorns painlessly popping out of the vines. As your torso changes, it begins to resemble more the wrapping brambles of a prickly shrub, twisting and winding about itself, only vaguely resembling that of an animal. Near the center, where your heart was, a glowing red flower begins to bloom the bud growing and then flowering. Through it you feel a strange connection, a comforting one. You are an extension of the Master, just like the vine you are suckling on.</p>\tThe transformation begins to go through your head as you come to this realization. Your antlers becoming wooden and then twisting around, the flash changing like the rest of your body, becoming leaner and more plant like, yet with a rougher appearance. Your Cervidae visage twisting into that of a canid, instinctively snarling a satisfied snarl with your tough wooden teeth. Sap leaking from the sides, partially as excess from the vine and partially as a hungry drool. The inside of your mouth changes to be leafy, excreting this sap. Then your eyes finally change, becoming glowing pits, your vision changing, colors becoming brighter and more saturated. The very heat of things seemingly glowing to you.</p>\tThe last thing to change, as per the control of your master, would be your privates. Whatever you had before, a strange purple flower would begin to grow around it. It would fill and bulge out, becoming a hardened, sap-filled bulb, always on edge and always leaking. Yet despite how needy it feels, you make no movements to touch it, knowing that it is only for the hunt, to slow down that delicious prey.</p>\tEventually, the Master removes his tentacle from our maw with a final spurt. And you stand, joining the rest of the pack, another one of the hounds. He stands proud upon his chariot, sounding his horn to start the hunt yet again. And so, you give chase, following his war path through the hunting grounds until you catch that irresistible scent of the prey. For you are the hunter. And the hunt is everything.",
