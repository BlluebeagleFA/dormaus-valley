His thick striped tail sways to and fro, blowing around the mixture of strange scents coming from the bottles and samples. \"Gehehe! A new customer! Would you like to sample one of my perfumes? I have scents for all seasons!\" he says. Do you want to take a sniff? [Contributed by Reese Ikena]",

Sort of musky, and earthy, and sweaty in a masculine, humid way. You find yourself drooling and blushing, your body tingling with a desperate need. When the skunk corks up the bottle again, you clutch the edge of his stand. Your mouth is dry, and you desperately need more. You reach out for the bottle, but the skunk pulls it away. \"Ah ah! Sorry hun, but that one is not for sale right now. I can do you a favour though! You can have some straight from the source.\" he says.  </p>The skunk stands up and drops his pants, before lifting his tail and bending over, showing off his fluffy black-furred rear. Your body moves on its own, as you walk behind the stall and press your face into the skunk's warm, musky rear. His tail lowers down over your head as you inhale the sweaty aroma from his fur. You start to kiss and lick his tailhole, nuzzling and making out with it like his butthole is your lover. Your tongue tastes his salty rear, and your lungs are filled with his scent. </p>The more you lick and rub your face against his rear, the more you start to change. Your face pushes forward, pressing into the skunk's butt as you grow a wet nose and a black and white striped muzzle. Black fur flows across your face and down your body, coating you in a smooth soft coat. Your tailbone aches and stretches out, growing and rising up behind you. It fluffs out with an enormous brush of fur, a massive tail almost as big as the entire rest of your body, with a big white warning stripe up the middle that goes all the way up your back. Your hands and feet grow padded and firm as you develop pawpads and claws, your whole body becoming a skunk just like the body of the man you're nuzzling. You remain behind the skunk's stall, licking and nuzzling his butt for the entire day, until he finishes selling his goods and packs up to go. He frees you, gives you a flick on the nose, and heads on his way. You lie on the ground for a while longer, slowly coming down from your bizarre rimjob-high, before you finally regain control of your senses.",

You feel a strange shifting under one foot, and you look down to see that the large, flat cobblestone you are stepping on looks unusual. You kneel down, and see to your surprise that the cobblestone has a face! </p>Engraved in the stone is a blank and smiling face, what looks almost like a flattened fox. In fact, on closer inspection, a lot of the stones here have faces. Most are worn from what must be decades or centuries of being stepped on, so they vary from fresh and obvious like this fox, to perfectly smooth like any other stone. </p>You are kneeling down, stroking and touching the stone face, curious and confused, when a shadow falls over you. You look up to see the mayor, smiling with a friendly grin. </p>'Ah, hello my friend! Admiring the stones, are we? Our wonderful town has a special tradition, and even the streets of this little slice of heaven are paved with people who loved this town so much, they wanted to contribute to it as the stones underfoot!' You are taken aback by this, having suspected that these stones may have been people, but still being surprised to hear it confirmed. The mayor continues. </p>'It's a good time, you know. Permanent of course, but you get to be a part of this town, a fundamental piece of the bedrock. Seeing the people coming and going, having the sun shine down on you, serving an important purpose. Would you be interested in joining them?' For such a shocking question, the portly cat says it with nonchalance that makes it sound like he's simply offering you a part-time job! Could you even consider giving up your life of adventure to be a simple cobblestone?",

I'm so pleased that you love our town so dearly! You do us a great honour. Now just strip down and lay on your back, I will do the rest!' You carefully remove your armor and place down all your belongings. Rocks don't need any of that stuff, of course. The mayor slides them away with one of his footpaws, probably to add to the donation box later. </p>You lie down in the street naked, the bright morning sun beating down on you. You actually feel surprisingly relaxed. Your fear and hesitation about this crazy decision seems to be almost melting away. You cross your arms behind your head and just stare up into the sky, breathing deeply and relaxing. You feel no shyness about lying naked in the street. In fact, you are so relaxed that you don't even notice when you stop breathing. </p>Your skin feels smooth, and firm, and hard. Your body feels slow and heavy. You probably could move, or wriggle, but you don't want to. Your natural twitches and motions slow down, to perfect stillness. Your eyes stare unblinkingly as your skin starts to turn grey, your insides hardening and stiffening. </p>When the mayor lifts one of his furry paws and walks across your belly, you don't react. You feel no pain or discomfort, and your flesh is as hard as stone. He walks over you again, stepping on your face and walking down your chest and off. Each time, you remain hard and firm, but you shrink and flatten a little more. His feet seem to get larger, covering more of your body and blocking out your vision a little more. </p>Over and over, and you just calmly sit and take every step of his feet. You don't know how long this lasts, but eventually, he looks down at you with a smug grin, walks off, and leaves you be. You can feel the other stones around you. You can't move at all, you can only sit and stare. </p></p>The next day, Mayor Maine walks past, and his wide soft orange foot presses right onto your face before he carries on without paying any more attention to you. When the sun sets, and rises, and sets, you realise your life is now one of eternally watching and supporting the people of Dormaus. Particularly the mayor, who makes a point of stepping on you on his way to work every day. You are nothing but a stone.",

The bird is struggling and panting, and the human merchant in the saddle atop it is getting impatient. You jump with surprise as Flute the fox appears, a wide grin on his face and a glowing green potion in his hand. \"Hello there traveller! I see your bird is struggling, well this potion is a rare one guaranteed to recover the stamina and strength of all mounts! Only two hundred gold!\" he says. The merchant looks skeptical, but tosses a bag of gold to Flute, instructing him gruffly that he will pay dearly if this is a scam. </p>Flute walks up to the exhausted bird, pats its cheek, and guides the potion to its beak. The effects are rapid - a glow envelops both the bird and his rider, and the bird bucks in the air, throwing the merchant to the ground. The bird's feathers start to recede, revealing tanned, smooth skin. His legs shrink down, and his small wings stretch out, feathers turning to fingers and bones forming new muscle. His beak shrinks and softens into a handsome, surprised face. Meanwhile, the merchant squawks and scrabbles on the ground, his boots tearing open to reveal massive talons. His arms bend and shrink, as feathers sprout all over his skin, yellow and soft. His neck stretches up, and his face hardens into a wide, powerful beak. He squawks and yelps, but the naked former-bird just grabs the fallen saddle and straps it to the merchant's back. </p>\"Many thanks, fox! Here, take the rest of my old master's cash. You earned it.\" he says. Flute catches a bag of gold as the former-bird tosses it, and watches the role-reversed pair trot off to market. \"Another satisfied customer\", he quips, before tossing you a couple of coins with a wink.",
