He grins when you notice. </p>"Don\'t worry, they had it coming. Don\'t spill beer on a man\'s boots." he says. </p>You see the boots wiggle and twitch slightly. From the rumors you\'ve heard about Ace\'s legendarily rank and smelly paws, you imagine those two are regretting their rudeness. The coyote tosses you something, and you catch a dusty, muddy pair of leather cowboy boots. They are soaked in booze, but the stink of ale is overpowered by a musky, masculine stench of sweat and hard work. It\'s so potent that you feel quite dizzy, though you have a bizarre urge to shove your nose in them and breathe deep. </p>"You can keep these old ones, partner. Should cover the cost of my chips. They were two folks too, once, but after a while they fade and turn to good, brown leather. Perfect for adventurers like us." he says.

You lose, you shrink." The grin on his long muzzle suggests that he knows something you don\'t know. You look at your cards, a two and a five. Naturally, Ace has two aces. Then on the next hand, you have a pair of fours, and Ace gets a straight. </p>Over and over, the coyote gets a perfect high-value hand, and you get trash. With each hand, you shrink a little more, your clothes becoming baggy and loose on your diminished body. </p>When you shrink below three feet tall, your skin starts to tingle and itch as it grows soft white fur. Your ears widen and stretch, becoming round and large atop your head. You squeak with indignation, and have to clamber up onto the table to be able to see the cards. A long tail starts to grow from your rear, pink and furless, and your face pushes out into a pointy little muzzle. </p>You look down at yourself, a cute, naked little white mouse, with small pink paws, a long tail and twitching whiskers, and you kick one of the cards in frustration. You accuse Ace of cheating, and he laughs. </p>"And whatcha\' gonna do about it, partner?" He leans forward, grabs you by the tail, and dangles you over his muzzle as you kick and struggle in the air, helpless in his grip.

He covers his face in shock as his mouth and nose pushes forward into a furry muzzle. His ears grow larger and flop down, and brown fur begins to flow over his skin. He barks again, stumbling on his feet as they grow longer, and then falls to all fours. His hands clutch together and shift, forming claws and pads as they become dog\'s paws. His wriggles and struggles cause him to slip free of his clothes, and a furry tail grows from his rear. He whimpers and whines, but the huge bandit grabs him by the scruff of his neck and drags him forward, shoving his sensitive nose into his sweaty crotch. </p>The dog looks shocked for a moment, then his tail starts to wag as his eyes darken into big, brown, ordinary dog eyes.
