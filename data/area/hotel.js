The innkeeper, a fat and sleepy-looking owl, is barely paying attention to their complaints about "cursed toys" and "being full of fluff". It seems he is quite used to this sort of thing, because after a while the two bears start to trail off, and look at eachother with their big fake plush eyes. </p>They stroke and touch one another, and then begin to cuddle and squeeze together. Their stitched-on happy expressions seem a little more genuine as they become too cuddle-obsessed to keep complaining, allowing the owl to return to reading his book.',

"This is an amulet of life saving! Restores you from any lethal fate!" he says eagerly. The owl looks at him with half-closed eyes. "It\'s an amulet of life preserving. It turns you into a mummy." he replies. Flute, ever undeterred, shows off a gleaming knife. "The blade of ages! Cuts anyone in half!" he says. </p>The owl yawns. "The blade of ages cuts anyone\'s AGE in half, and makes them younger. Which that isn\'t. It\'s a bread knife. From my own kitchen." he says. The fox tosses the knife aside with the same wide grin, and pulls a badge out from his tunic, with a large paw print on it. "Well what about this then? Took it from that weird old cave, definitely magical, probably makes you all stompy and powerful." he says. </p>The owl grins a bit as he sees it, and hooks one feather-finger into Flute\'s jerkin, pulling him around behind the counter. "Flute, that\'s the badge of paw slavery. Anyone holding one is marking themselves as an obedient paw slut." he says. Flute makes a startled noise, but his yelp turns to a moan of lust as he is lowered to the owl\'s clawed feet behind the counter. You see the proud fox try desperately to resist, but he\'s soon rubbing and massaging the owl\'s talons with a frustrated and confused erection. You wonder if you could get yourself one of those badges.',

On a small stage next to the dining area, a white rabbit with a waistcoat and top hat is performing magic tricks. His black bowtie is quite cute on his furry neck. He makes cards disappear, and correctly guesses which fetish the volunteer is thinking of. Then, for the big finish, he gets an adventurer to come up on stage. With a wave of his wand, the human starts to growl and shudder. </p>Fur sprouts across his flesh, and his face pushes forward as he opens his mouth wide, showing off enormous razor-sharp white fangs. His body thickens with powerful, predatory muscles. His fingers flex as his nails turn to huge sharp claws, and then his hands thicken into furry orange paws. He falls to all fours, his armor snapping open under his growing bulk. He shakes it off, growling and snarling, and stretches his body as his bones reshape for quadrupedal movement. A long sinuous striped orange tail curves behind him, as the enormous new tiger prowls on the stage. The rabbit flourishes and bows, expecting clapping, but nothing happens. </p>He blinks and raises an eyebrow. "Er. This is considered very impressive where I am from..." he mutters. You suppose it\'s hard to impress people with transformation in a town where it happens around every corner. He finishes up his act, leaving behind the tiger, who makes a confused growl that you interpret to mean "Wait, are you leaving me like this?"',
