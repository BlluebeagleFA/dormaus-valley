                        "text": "You approach Saberhagen as he is handing out some cookies from his stall. They are carved to look like grinning pumpkin faces, and smell strongly of cinnamon. He hands you one as you get close. \"Freshly made! I'm giving the last batch away before I head over to enjoy the sights!\", he says. You ask him if he'd like to go with you, and he makes a squeaky gasp. \"R-really? Of course! That sounds wonderful!\", he says. His furry black cheeks glow a little red under his mask. You help him close up his tent by rolling down the canvas and putting away the baking supplies, and then you accompany him out through the market grounds.</p>Despite the sun long since being down, the town is ablaze with lights and colour. Glowing red lanterns are hung from every corner, and orange and yellow streamers and banners are strung up between buildings and across rooftops and signs. When the wind rustles them, it looks almost like fire. The streets are crowded with throngs of people, all in costume. Many of them are wearing red with oranate masks, like Saberhagen, but more are wearing monster designs, with tattered clothes, big fangs, and silly horns. Saberhagen insists on complimenting the costumes of almost everyone you pass. Treats and confections are placed for passers-by on tables and stands, and you stop to try some with the eager cat. His tail twitches and wiggles with excitement as he tries a sugar-dusted gelatin cube, and then a small pastry with swirls of icing. \"They're all so wonderful! I want to try everything!\", he says. You notice that next to this stand is a large wooden tub of water, with apples floating in it. Saberhagen sees you looking, and takes a glance himself. \"Oh! It's a traditional apple dunking tub! You are supposed to grab one with only your mouth, and one of them will have a lucky coin inside!\", he says. He stands over it, and hesitantly bends over, then backs off. \"I, er, I don't handle water well...\", he admits shyly.</p>You stand next to him and place your hands on either side of the tub. Taking a deep breath, you plunge your head into the water and bite down firmly on an apple, before pulling it up. Water cascades down your head, and you drop your prize into Saberhagen's hands. His eyes light up as he takes it and pulls out a small coin from the side. \"You got me the lucky one! This is...so amazing!\", he says.</p>He lifts his hands, bites his lip, and then grabs your hands in his. His soft black fingers stroke across yours, and his cheeks blush hotter. \"This calls for a special reward. I have the perfect idea! Just stand close to me\", he says. You walk closer, feeling his chest against yours, and he closes his eyes. A ring of light forms on the floor around you, and the world beyond it goes dark. There is a sudden flash, and you feel like you are falling. Then, in an instant, you are somewhere else. The air is hot and heavy, and the sounds of celebration and revelry are everywhere.</p>You look around at the wet, stone-paved streets and tall buildings, and see a parade of people walking past. They're wearing painted skull masks, and bright, colourful costumes. They dance and spin as they pass, all carrying tall lanterns. Saberhagen grips your hand tighter. \"It's Nuit de la mémoire!\", he says. \"I teleported us to Glowscale! Oh gosh, I wasn't sure it would work, that was a fourth circle spell. When you're here, I feel like I could cast anything.\"</p>He looks up at you, and gulps. He looks like he's about to say something, but then one of the passing partiers bumps into you. The masked lizard hands you both small cups of colourful liquid. \"Désolé l'ami. Ici, prenez un verre!\", he says. Saberhagen looks down at the little cup with interest. \"Oh! I think it's a traditional drink, I can't remember what they call it. I always wanted to try it!\", he says. You both take a sip. It's fruity and warm, a little like cider. Not bad.</p>Saberhagen, however, reacts rather differently. He giggles, and his eyes close over a little. \"Oh gosh!\", he says. He hiccups, and stumbles back a bit. \"Was, was that is what alcohol is like?\", he asks. You quickly reach out and grab him just before he falls over, and he leans onto your chest. He looks up at you with a dizzy smile and a goofy, unfocused stare. \"Oh gosh, you're so handsome, you know. You're my, my knight in shinning...in armor. My big daddy to look after me\", he says, before nuzzling and rubbing his face into your chest.</p>Your body jolts with a sudden surge of powerful, tingling magic. Your muscles throb with strength and power, as you feel yourself starting to grow. Your bones ache as you stretch out, getting taller and taller. Your neck thickens with muscle, while your arms start to inflate and grow. Thick, heavy biceps bulge from your upper arms. Your shoulders widen and stretch out, while your chest grows hard and firm, with thick pecs and rugged, chiselled abs. With a soft, velvety sensation, fur starts to grow all over your powerful changed body. Black and smooth and sleek, spreading over your chest and down your arms. Your feet stretch out too, your toes flexing as they become padded, clawed feline toes. A long black tail stretches from your rear, flexing and twitching as it moves behind you. You feel compelled to purr and grin, as your jaw and nose adjust and change. Moving and growing forward into a muzzle, with your nose flattening and becoming a flat, pink triangle on your dark black face. Teeth growing sharp and white, becoming powerful fangs in a handsome grin. Your ears growing furry and pointed, and your eyes glowing in the dark, as you feel your body become a tall and powerful black cat.</p>You try to say something, but your voice comes out in a deep, rich masculine tone. \"Of course I am, my little princess...\", you find yourself saying to him, as you stroke the side of his head. Somehow, you can't stop thinking of how you have to protect and cherish the smaller cat. To pleasure and play with him, keep him close and safe, to be his powerful daddy cat. Saberhagen's secret, embarrassing fantasies are flowing out as magical energy in his drunken state, and changing you into his fantasy boyfriend!</p>You close your eyes and struggle to hold onto your normal mind, but when you open them again, you feel your will melt away. Your wonderful little pet is here, and those thoughts are not important. You must show him a good time.</p>You take him by the hand, and twirl him gently, before pulling him back close against you. Your deep, rumbling purr echoes in his ear as you stroke his chest slowly with your huge and powerful hand. \"Shall we dance, princess?\", you growl, and he shivers.</p>Gently stroking and guiding him, you pull him out into the parade. Along with the other partygoers, you dance and follow with the lights. The parade stops at houses along the way, where people give out food and more drinks. You drink every one, your powerful body barely affected by the liquor, but you gently prevent your boyfriend from taking any more. You have to protect him, after all.</p>As the night goes on, Saberhagen starts to tire out, so you lift him up with ease and carry him. His face nuzzles into your furry neck, and you stroke your hand along his back and thigh. Eventually, the parade flows out into a large courtyard in front of a massive gilded building. A tall, muscular black alligator stands atop a platform in the center of the courtyard, shouting out in a deep, booming voice. Although he is speaking Glowscale, you understand every word. After all, you must know many things to appropriately care for your beloved Saberhagen.</p>\"Do any couples wish to take on the promise bands, this night?\", the gator shouts. You raise your hand and grin. \"We wish to, Monsieur\", you say. The gator ushers you forward, and you carry Saberhagen onto the platform.</p>\"With this band, let these two pledge allegience to one another. Do you agree to protect and cherish this cat?\", he asks you. You nod. \"And do you pledge to serve and obey your lover?\", he asks Saberhagen. Saberhagen nods and blushes harder. The gator places a slender silver collar around Saberhagen's neck, then hands you a silver key on a chain. \"Then let it be pledged! I hope to see you again next year, you are a beautiful couple\", he says.</p>You lean down and kiss Saberhagen firmly, your powerful face pressed into his smaller, softer one. He squirms and wraps his arms around your neck, and you feel a familiar sensation. The ring of light reappears, and there is a rushing, whooshing feeling of great travel. You land inside Saberhagen's closed tent, atop his bed. He is still clinging to your neck, but his eyes are closed, and he is snoring gently. It seems the party was too much for your little 'princess'.</p>You lay him down gently on his bed, and kiss his cheek, before slipping out through the tent. The next morning, when you awaken, you are still in the body of this tall and powerful black cat, but your mind has returned mostly to its normal state. When you see Saberhagen later, you can't help but think how incredibly cute and adorable he is, but otherwise you are your usual self. He keeps toying with the collar around his neck.</p>\"Oh, there you are! I wanted to ask, what happened last night? I don't really remember anything past Glowscale\", he says nervously. You just grin and stroke his cheek.</p>\"Just a little party, princess\", you say. He blushes and squeaks, and you feel compelled to wink at him before leaving.",

He pulls off the large leather gloves that cover his hands, and carefully holds your own in his soft furry paws. Almost immediately he jerks his hands back, and steps backwards in surprise. "I-incredible! Where in the fourth world are you from, friend? You have more magical potential than I\'ve ever seen! It must be very difficult for you to travel on your adventures without being constantly affected by spells and transformations! I know just the recipe for you", he says.</p>The cat ducks back into his tent, and begins to fiddle with his bowls and ingredients. You wait patiently as he kneads a roll of dough and places it into the oven. He returns not much time later, and hands you a small, freshly baked bun, with a symbol carved into the top. When you bite into it, you feel a powerful energy flow through your body. It moves through your veins like electricity, and you feel a rush of power and knowledge.</p>You can now cast the spells Befox and Berabbit on other players, by typing "/fox (username)" or "/rabbit (username)" into the chat window.',

"Ah, you\'re that friend of Saberhagen\'s, correct? You can call me Ritter. I am here to collect those lovely little stones on my fellow student\'s behalf", he says. He stands up and takes the stones from you before you can protest. His eyes go wide as he looks at them. "Incredible quality! You must have found a very potent manse, for them to have formed in such excellent condition. Here, I will reward you with my favourite spell", the cat says.</p>Ritter looks around Saberhagen\'s tent, and finds a white bread roll. He takes a bite out of it with his sharp fangs, and then places one of his arms around your shoulders, and presses his face against yours. As he kisses you, he pushes the bread into your mouth. His muzzle rubs against your face and his arms are powerful despite his seemingly slender body. There is a prickle and crackle of electric energy, as you feel more magical knowledge burn through your mind.

His form of baking is a little more magical than you might expect, but your own knowledge of such things is more than up to the task. When the dough gets mad and start to form itself into a big goopy fist, you just challenge it to rock paper scissors. The rolls try to roll away, so you put them in a big bowl so they can bounce around with eachother without causing trouble. Even the croissants, a notoriously difficult pastry to wrangle, are no match for you. When they try to whip at you like soft little sickles, you catch them in a net. They struggle in there uselessly, making angry little \'hon\' noises.</p>Saberhagen himself is amazed with your skills. With the other tasks handled he\'s able to make several more batches of goods than he normally would. He dashes all around the tent, setting things up and pulling new bread out of his little oven, until he bumps into you by accident. His chest lands against yours and he looks at you with surprise, along with a little bit of a blush barely visible under his dark fur.</p>You get out of his way and start to cover the front counter, where you soon realise that Saberhagen is a very popular merchant. A small crowd gathers very early on, eager to start their day with fresh bread. With how much extra you\'ve been able to make, you even have some left over after the initial rush. Passing merchants and shoppers try out your stocks on a whim, and soon you have even more customers who will be making regular visits to get more in the future.</p>At the end of the day, Saberhagen invites you over to a few cushions by his warm hearth, and splits some pumpkin pie with you. It\'s warm and freshly made, and you feel surprisingly at home in his little tent. He splits the day\'s takings with you evenly, resulting in a very reasonable little pile of coins. "Thanks so much for your help today! We made more food than ever, and everyone seemed really happy. I really appreciate you spending the day with me", he says. His eyes shine brightly and happily in the dim tent, and you finish up the pie before leaving.',

                        "text": 'While Saberhagen is overjoyed to have someone helping him in his little tent, you soon discover that baked goods in this land are far more complicated than you\'d imagine. When you try to knead the dough, it rises up in the shape of a fist and knocks you away. The rolls keep rolling around the tent, gathering dust, and the croissants are just completely impossible to argue with. They keep flying over your head, getting tangled in the sheets.</p>Despite your constant screwups, Saberhagen remains very positive. He reprimands the dough for hitting you, shows you how to kneel down when getting the rolls so you don\'t spook them, and gives you a net to catch the croissants with. When you try to handle the dough for the second time, he puts his hands in with you, guiding you along and teaching you how to push through the warm soft dough without making it annoyed. His hand touches yours in the bowl, and you see his whiskers twitch a little in embarrassment.</p>After the baking is all done, or at least the parts of it that can be salvaged, you cover the front counter for a while. You are surprised to discover how popular Saberhagen\'s food is. A small crowd gathers in the morning, eager to start their day with some fresh bread from "that nice cat who is visiting". Although you sell out everything you baked, with how much you messed up, the tent barely makes enough money to cover the cost of ingredients.</p>You are expecting to be sent home with just bruises and no money, when Saberhagen cheerfully walks up and holds your hands with his own soft furry black ones. You feel a calming warmth flow through you, and your minor injuries from the day are washed away. He then presses a couple of coins into your palm. "Here you go, friend. Your half for the day!", he says. You feel a little guilty for taking the money, but he waves it off. "Don\'t be silly! No one is perfect their first time trying. I am sure you\'ll be a great baker one day! Don\'t get discouraged!", he says. Maybe you actually will, with a teacher like him.',

The romance novels he\'s so ashamed of that he hides in the back of his tent, for example. He\'s clearly never going to work up the courage to make a move though, so maybe you need to make one for him.</p>As you work at the bakery today, you spend a little extra time focusing on Saberhagen. After he pulls out some freshly baked rolls from his oven, you walk up close to him and rub his shoulders. His body is lithe and thin under his robes, and he blushes a little. "Ah, how unexpected. What brought this on?", he asks. You tell him that he just looks like he\'s been working hard and needs a bit of attention. His fluffy ears twitch a bit, and he looks away, but he doesn\'t stop you from your massage. You press your fingers into his shoulders and along the back of his neck, and you feel a faint rumbling, along with a low, quiet sound. He\'s purring!</p>Taking the opportunity, you reach down under the hem of his thick leather robe and push your hands up under it. Your fingers stroke into the soft, warm black fur on his back, and he makes a nervous yelp. His tail twitches and lashes, but as you continue to stroke and touch him, his tension and shyness very gradually recede. He leans backwards into your touch, and you stroke your hands down his shoulderblades and then around his chest, holding him close to you. He purrs a little more, then coughs. "Um, my sincerest thanks for that. It was very considerate of you", he stammers, before gently untangling himself and going back to work.</p>Later that day, you make an idle complaint about how warm it is, and take off your shirt. You are amused to notice that he stares at you and blushes deeply every time he thinks you\'re not looking. It seems the cat has a crush on you. The next day when you come to work, you discover a letter from him near the work desk. "Dearest Friend, I really think that you would make a fine magician. With your adventuring skills, I am sure you could find the rare items I need to make spellbread designed just for you. Please give this to the mayor as a letter of recommendation for a license to become an official treasure digger. I would take you myself, but I confess I find myself overcome with an uncharacteristic shyness as of late. Deepest regards, Saberhagen"',

Likely because you aren\'t wearing a shirt, but he keeps looking over, and the distraction makes him stumble, or drop his bread, or knock over some books. By the end of the day he\'s a blushing nervous mess. You help him close up the store, but instead of leaving for the day like normal, you walk into the tent with him. He looks up at you, his cat eyes shining in the dark tent. "Oh! Goodness, is there something I can, er, help you with?", he asks.</p>You tell him that actually, there is. Then, you take hold of his wrist and pull him close to you. His arms are slim and soft, and he doesn\'t resist at all. In fact, he looks completely star struck. You lean in close to him, and press your face to his soft furry muzzle. Your tongue slides into his mouth as you kiss him, feeling the smooth points of his teeth, and the hot warmth of his rough tongue. Judging by his nervousness and the motion of his tongue, you\'re probably his first kiss. You lean back and look at him, his face almost glowing with the red blush that covers his cheeks and muzzle. "I, oh, scholars, er...at the tower, we\'re not supposed to engage in...", he says, stumbling over his words.</p>You take his shaky hands and press them onto your chest, letting him feel your body. He strokes them over you, and bites his lower lip nervously. You can see him looking intensely at your crotch, and you oblige him by reaching down and pushing them off you, to reveal your erect cock. He almost gasps as it rises up into the air, and his whiskers twitch.</p>You reach forward and push open his robe, sliding it across his shoulders until it falls to the floor under its own weight. Then, in an authoritative tone, you tell him to take off his shirt and pants. He hesitates for a moment, but he can\'t take his eyes off your cock, and he pulls his shirt up over his head. His torso is the same shade of silky black as the rest of his body, and his chest is slender and narrow. You walk closer, and slide your hands along his hips, feeling his soft fur, before you push down his breeches, to reveal his hard, pre-leaking cock. He looks up at you and leans in for another kiss, which you oblige. Though his motions are still nervous and unsure, you can tell he\'s excited. You hold onto his cock, feeling its firmness in your hand as you slowly stroke and tease him. He purrs and yowls, wiggling at your touch. "I\'ve...I\'ve never...", he mutters, but you just lower him down onto the cushions that scatter the floor of the tent.</p>The cat closes his eyes and shakes a little as you lift his legs up and press your cock to his tailhole. He\'s very tight, and as you push forward, you feel him gasp and squirm. However, you soon manage to slide yourself into him, and feel his ass clenching around your cock. You start to thrust, pushing your cock into him, in and out, getting faster and faster. He pants and gasps, his own cock bouncing and leaking large amounts of precum. "I can\'t, it\'s, I!", he stammers, before yowling and suddenly cumming after only a few thrusts. His cock pulses and gushes a thick stream of cum into the air, but as it does so, a rush of almost electrical energy explodes from his fur and blasts into you. You find yourself yowling too, and thrusting hard into his rear as you shudder with sensation. Your skin prickles as soft black fur grows all over you. Your hands and feet sting as sharp, narrow claws push out from the tips. Your tailbone grows out, flicking and shaking as it stretches into a thin, furry feline tail. With the change comes a growing pleasure, and as your ears stretch up and grow pointed and triangular atop your head, you gasp. Your face pushes forward into a short, streamlined muzzle, and you grunt as you start to cum. Your cock unloads hot, dripping cum deep into Saberhagen\'s rear, overwhelmed by the pleasure of your changes. When you pull out, you leave him an oozing mess, and he covers his face with embarrassment. "I\'m so sorry! I lost control! I, but, you make a very handsome cat", he says shyly. You grin at him, and stand up, feeling your new feline body. This could certainly be fun.',

                        "text": 'You choose a day where Saberhagen has been paying particular attention to you. Likely because you aren\'t wearing a shirt, but he keeps looking over, and the distraction makes him stumble, or drop his bread, or knock over some books. By the end of the day he\'s a blushing nervous mess. You help him close up the store, but instead of leaving for the day like normal, you walk into the tent with him. He looks up at you, his cat eyes shining in the dark tent. "Oh! Goodness, is there something I can, er, help you with?", he asks.</p>You tell him that actually, there is. Then, you take hold of his wrist and pull him close to you. His arms are slim and soft, and he doesn\'t resist at all. In fact, he looks completely star struck. You lean in close to him, and press your face to his soft furry muzzle. Your tongue slides into his mouth as you kiss him, feeling the smooth points of his teeth, and the hot warmth of his rough tongue. Judging by his nervousness and the motion of his tongue, you\'re probably his first kiss. You lean back and look at him, his face almost glowing with the red blush that covers his cheeks and muzzle. "I, oh, scholars, er...at the tower, we\'re not supposed to engage in...", he says, stumbling over his words.</p>You take his shaky hands and press them onto your chest, letting him feel your breasts. He strokes them, his eyes wide in admiration, and bites his lower lip nervously. You can see him looking intensely at your body, and you oblige him by reaching down and pushing your pants off, to reveal your full nudity. He almost gasps as your clothes drop to the floor, and his whiskers twitch.</p>You reach forward and push open his robe, sliding it across his shoulders until it falls to the floor under its own weight. Then, in an authoritative tone, you tell him to take off his shirt and pants. He hesitates for a moment, but he can\'t take his eyes off your body, and he pulls his shirt up over his head. His torso is the same shade of silky black as the rest of his body, and his chest is slender and narrow. You walk closer, and slide your hands along his hips, feeling his soft fur, before you push down his breeches, to reveal his hard, pre-leaking cock. He looks up at you and leans in for another kiss, which you oblige. Though his motions are still nervous and unsure, you can tell he\'s excited. You hold onto his cock, feeling its firmness in your hand as you slowly stroke and tease him. He purrs and yowls, wiggling at your touch. "I\'ve...I\'ve never...", he mutters, but you just lower him down onto the cushions that scatter the floor of the tent.</p>The cat closes his eyes and shakes a little as you lift yourself up and slide down onto his cock. You push forward, and feel him gasp and squirm. You start to thrust, riding him, in and out, getting faster and faster. He pants and gasps, his own cock leaking large amounts of precum inside you. "I can\'t, it\'s, I!", he stammers, before yowling and suddenly cumming after only a few moments. His cock pulses and gushes a thick stream of cum, filling you with warmth deep inside, but as it does so, a rush of almost electrical energy explodes from his fur and blasts into you. You find yourself yowling too, and hilting his cock inside you as you shudder with sensation. Your skin prickles as soft black fur grows all over you. Your hands and feet sting as sharp, narrow claws push out from the tips. Your tailbone grows out, flicking and shaking as it stretches into a thin, furry feline tail. With the change comes a growing pleasure, and as your ears stretch up and grow pointed and triangular atop your head, you gasp. Your face pushes forward into a short, streamlined muzzle, and you grunt as you start to orgasm too, overwhelmed by the pleasure of your changes. When you pull out, you leave him an oozing mess, and he covers his face with embarrassment. "I\'m so sorry! I lost control! I, but, you make a very beautiful cat", he says shyly. You grin at him, and stand up, feeling your new feline body. This could certainly be fun.',

The other cat wizard has lunged forward with lightning speed and grabbed you in one of his hands, and you are dangling upside down by your tail, dizzy from the haste. You notice his claws are out, shiny and gleaming, and his mouth is drooling. </p>You wiggle and squeak, and Saberhagen drags the cat into his tent. "Let him go, Ritter! They don\'t eat people here!", Saberhagen pleads, but the other cat is snarling. "I try so hard to remain dignified..." he mutters, dropping you on the ground. When you scurry to escape, he lunges and slams a hand down in front of you, and when you retreat, he does it again. He purrs with amusement. "But this absurd town...letting MICE wander around freely! How can I resist that?!" he says. </p>He snaps his fingers, and his robes and hat disappear in a puff of smoke. Saberhagen is thrust across the room, his arms bound with gleaming strands of green light. Ritter\'s body is lean and lithe, his black fur sleek on his slender body. Between his legs, a furry black sheath holds a firm, erect cock. The whiteness of his grin stands out in the dark tent, almost like a cheshire cat\'s disembodied smile. Whether or not you find him attractive, his actions have triggered some primal survival instinct in your rodent body, and you spin around for a moment and flee as fast as your little paws will carry you. </p>There is another puff of purple smoke, and suddenly you are running along a warm, black, furry surface. You look up to see that you\'re walking on Ritter\'s chest, running towards his face! He grabs you, and drops you down between his legs, where you land on his twitching cock. Before you can move, he grips you firmly in his hand, and starts to squeeze you against his shaft. He pulls you up and down, rubbing you along his cock like a fuck toy, and the more you squeak and struggle, the more he purrs and the harder he gets.</p> "Mice...are toys. Toys for cats to amuse themselves with, and then, when we are done...to devour." he whispers. Pre oozes from his bulging cock and soaks your fur, making you slippery and wet. Just as his cock is bobbing and tensing, about to blow, he grabs you in his hand and lifts you to his mouth. You dangle over his wide, gaping maw, until suddenly your stomach lurches as you are dropped. You land on Ritter\'s wide, rough tongue, clinging on desperately as his fanged maw closes around you. In the dark wetness of his mouth, his tongue slides up and down your chest, licking and teasing you all over. You can feel how aroused he is by his panting breath over you, and the moans and purrs emitting from his throat. </p>With a shudder, and a loud, orgasmic moan, the cat blows his load, and swallows you at the same time. You are sent down a slippery slide along the tight confines of Ritter\'s throat and into his belly, even as he soaks his own chestfur with creamy cum.',

                        "text": 'You decide to sate your curiosity and enter the unusual shop. When you open the door a bell above you rings, and you walk forward into the dimly lit shop. All around you, you see mascot costumes hanging from the racks. They are really colorful ranging from bright neon blues and reds to dimmer brown and whites. The heads of the costumes appear to be on some shelves on the left side of the store. Their eyes blankly stare at you with perpetual smiles on their faces. You decide to walk around to shop to see if you can find the store owner or a desk, but all you find, other than more of the costumes, is an intricate gilded mirror in the back of the store.</p>After a while of waiting in the store, you decide to leave, confident that no store clerk or owner is going to arrive. You make it all the way across the store and start to open the door when you hear a large crash behind you. When you turn around you see one of the costumes, fallen on the ground. </p>Out of common courtesy you go to put the costume back where it belongs. However when your hand touches the surprisingly soft fur, you instantly have an urge to try the suit on. You pick it up and start to look at it. It is a blue and white furred costume with a tail in the back and attached arm and leg paws. You check a tag on the bottom of the tail and realize that the costume is meant to be an arctic fox. You look around to make sure no one is around and with the suit in your hands you walk toward the mirror. You hesitate for a second, staring into the smooth inside of the suit not sure why you are doing this, but nevertheless you begin to slip on the suit. The inside feels warm and smooth to the touch, and it slides perfectly onto your body. </p>Zipped up, the suit fits perfectly upon your body, almost as if it was made specifically for you. You look in the mirror and move around, seeing how it looks on you. Other than your head, which is contrasting with the rest of your body, you think that you look great. Everything below looks like a larger than life fox. Your “paws” are slightly oversized, your “tail” is extremely bushy and sways almost lifelike when you move, and the white and blue color palette accentuates the suit on your body. </p>You start to lose track of the time as you keep posing and turning with the suit on your body, it becoming an obsession. After a while you decide it is finally time to take off the suit and you attempt to pull down the zipper. As you do, you find that it is stuck and you can’t pull it down. No matter how hard you pull down, it doesn’t budge an inch. You keep trying, slight panic swelling up from within you.</p>Then a calm thought, not entirely your own, enters your mind. “The suit is not complete…” At this you realize what was off all along. You were missing your head. You immediately run to the rack of heads you saw before and search for yours. It doesn’t take long, the right one standing out as bright as day. In the middle of the shelves, it is blue and white, like the rest of your body. The large cartoon eyes and gleaming smile practically telling you to put it on then and there. And so you do. You close your eyes and take the mask off the shelf, slipping it onto your head. It fits perfectly, like the rest of the suit, and slipping it on makes you feel a comfort you never felt before. Unknown to you, the head of the suit merged with the suit’s body, becoming one over your own.</p>At this you finally feel complete and whole, the suit filling the emptiness inside you. Conversely, your body begins to disappear under the suit, becoming a void beneath the cloth of the costume. Your “body” becomes lighter and hollower, just as it always was meant to be. You open your “eyes” and look around the shop. Then you look down at the zipper which confounded you earlier, and pull it down with ease. Inside your suit there is nothing but the inner black lining, and you feel happy. After a while you leave the shop content, but slightly confused why you went to a costume shop since as far as you can remember you can remember, you were always a walking fursuit.

He rubs and squeezes, massaging deeply into your body.</p>You hadn't realised how stressed and tired you were. His fingers rub and push, stretching and kneading you. You sink back against the chair, sighing happily. It's impossible to focus on your worries, with him massaging you. Each time you have a thought of concern or fear, he squeezes harder, and the thought melts away.</p>He starts moving his hands down your arms, squeezing and stroking and rubbing. Your muscles feel loose and soft, as your muscle definition starts to fade. Strength decreasing a little, muscle and athleticism becoming just a bit softer and weaker.</p>He moves over in front of you, and lifts your feet. His thick, expert fingers rub and stroke over your soles, and he squeezes and rubs each toe in turn. Your gracefulness and dexterity starts to fade, your limbs and joints getting a little clumsier, a little louder and more crude. Your feet feel so relaxed and you lean back happily, but you can feel your skills degrading with every touch.</p>He leans against you, his enormous furry belly pressed atop your chest like a heavy weight pinning you down. His fingers stroke along your face, rubbing and gently massaging your cheeks and your neck. Your features become a little rougher, a little less appealing. Your voice slightly less convincing and charismatic, your appearance more plain. Finally, his hands slide up atop your head, and he begins to massage your scalp. Clawed fingertips gently stroking across your scalp, thick pads pushing in against your head. Your mind feels foggy and empty, your thoughts getting slower and more simple. Your whole body tingles as your magical attributes drain, along with some of your intelligence. You look up at the tanuki, seeing him grinning widely, his eyes glowing even as his body is cast in shadow from looming atop you.</p>He strokes his fingers gently down your head, tracing them down across your neck and down your chest. You shudder and lean back, feeling tired and drained. A glowing, tingling feeling flows from your fingertips to your chest, as a glittering light appears at his fingertips. He draws it out, pulling away slowly like stretching taffy, and empties the glittering light into a small vial. You pant, feeling dizzy and sweaty and utterly exhausted.</p>He stands up, freeing you from the weight of his huge belly, and places a large sack of coins on your lap. \"Many thanks, friend! This is an excellent batch of aptitude!\", he says.</p>He pulls you to your feet, and pats your back gently. \"I'd love to take a little more some time, but it will have to wait for another day.

Isn't it wonderful! Since we came here it's just been so wonderful seeing all the different fun and lovely ways people celebrate together! We never had anything like this in the tower!\", he says.</p>He takes your hand and pulls you into his tent. First, he shows you a table covered in grinning candy pumpkins, spiders and other monstrous confections. \"So, these are for the Night of the Red King. It's a really old tradition back from the days of the Kingdom of Dormaus, or maybe even older than that. It's spread around all over the country now. The Red King is a mythical being that destroys civilisations to spread his evil and corrupted desires, so each year when he is supposed to visit, we all dress up like monsters and decorate with scary objects, to fool him into thinking he already took this place, so he will move on. It's such fun, I think it's my favourite one!\", he says.</p>Next he shows you some toasted snacks he's made. Marshmallows on long sticks, roasted apples, and some hot cocoa bubbling in a pot. \"These are for Rebel's Bonfire. It's a fairly new tradition down here, but up in Horn they've celebrated it for almost a hundred years. They have a folk hero up there called Bass, who I think is based on a real person that died during the revolution where the gryphons took over. Every year they burn a big bonfire and gather around it to remember him, and so that he will look out on them from the fire and protect them for another year. Recently, the fires have been getting integrated as part of Red Night too, which I think is rather charming.\"</p>Adjacent to the roasting snacks is a platter full of steaming, crisp roasted yams, and cranberry tarts. \"I still have a few extra I need to make for this, but these are for Wolf's Night. In Westwood, they have a folk hero similar to Bass, called Lycaeon the Wolf. He was the mythical king of Westwood when it was called Wolfwood, back when they say the desert was a beautiful verdant paradise. Each year you throw a big party with your family and loved ones, so that you will be ready to celebrate when the wolf comes home, and returns Westwood to its true glory. There is a lot of food in this celebration! I hope I can prepare enough.\"</p>Up next is a cooling tray, on which a number of very plain round white cookies are resting. Saberhagen has also made some sticky white rabbits to go with them. \"This is for the Luna Festival. It's a much rarer one, but I wanted to make sure that if we do have any Lunarians visiting, they'll feel welcome. The moon is going to look very large this time of year, and so Lunarians take this time to thank their moon goddess for giving them life. They give eachother these little moon cookies, and I made these little bunnies as well since their goddess is a white rabbit. I hope that isn't too disrespectful, it's very hard to find a Lunarian to ask!\"</p>Finally, he shows you a wall hanging with colourful decorations of skulls, bones and snakes. They're slightly clumsily made, but covered in glittery papers and stones. \"Last but not least, I made these for Nuit de la mémoire. Traditionally there's no food for this one, but this is roughly the time of year where people from Glowscale have a big party with a lot of drinking and dancing, to remember their past and celebrate the future. It's based on a very, very old lizard celebration which I believe was more to do with meditation and reflection, but over time it became more of a fun, outgoing sort of thing. I am hoping to ask Grizz if he can help me make some traditional drinks for it!\"</p>Saberhagen gives you a big grin. His enthusiasm for the festivities is a little infectious. \"I hope you have a great time at the festival too! I have a lot of work before then, I want everyone to really have a wonderful, exciting night\", he says. You take your leave, and let him get back to his baking and decorating.",

Feeling the deep magic in the caves, the heavy, bass pumping magic in the forests. You send your feelings out further, touching gently across the sea and north to the cold, icy lands where the magic is wild and unpredictable.</p>It becomes harder and harder to hear Saberhagen's words as you feel almost addicted to this connection and feeling. You brush your senses further north, and then, suddenly, everything else drops away.</p>It is like you were straining your eyes to see something in the sky, and then you glanced at the sun. At the furthest north is a magic so massive and heavy that it makes your head almost split. You feel yourself falling, feel the tendrils of the spell snapping and collapsing. Saberhagen lunges and tries to grab you, but his hands pass through you.</p>You are flying wildly and unpredictably through the air, moving miles in an instant. Your connection to the spell falls apart, and you scream as you fall and crash into the ground.

In Flute’s right arm are a few purple and blue hoodies, looking quite out of place in this rural fantasy environment. The one on top looks almost custom made for the dog, with extensions on the hood to accommodate for his ears. On the hood there is also yellow eyes that almost seemed to glow and little cloth teeth on the brim. The dog seems very eager, a small bag of gold in his hand and his tail wagging behind him.</p>Flute eagerly takes the gold out of the dog’s hands and tosses him the hoodie from the top of the pile. “Enjoy the purchase, and you know what? Have the rest on the house!” Flute tosses the rest of the hoodies onto the ground nearby and walks away, counting the money in the bag. The dog quickly and happily puts on the article of clothing, his tail wagging even more. He zips it up, leaving the hood down and looks at it on his body. It fits snug, and comfortably on him. He smiles and emphatically exclaims “This stange garment is cool!”</p>While the dog admires his new hoodie jacket, you spot the hood oddly move up on its own. With a single soft FWIP, the hood completely covers all of the dog’s face except for the mouth. “AH!! What the?!” yells the dog. He starts to pull at the hood panicking, trying to get it off. The “eyes” of the hood begin to glow even brighter with an unearthly light. The strings of the hood pull down further, all on their own, tightening the hood to his head. Soon you see the dog hunched over, his tail no longer wagging and his arms hanging down. In a matter of seconds, all struggling was over. You then see him walk slowly toward the pile of hoodies. He picks them up one by one, slowly his arms move as he was a zombie. When he finally picks all of them up, he starts walking by you and you hear in a deeper monotone “I… Obey… The … Hood…” </p>After he passes by, you resolve to yourself to not buy any strange pieces of clothing from flute, or wear one of those hoods.
