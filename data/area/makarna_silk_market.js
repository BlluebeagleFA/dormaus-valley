Best balloons in Makarna!\", he bellows.",

                        "text": "You walk up to the store and admire his balloons. The rubber is thick and firm to the touch, but still smooth and pleasantly inflated. The balloons have endearing shapes, like full bodies of faceless rubber animals rather than the twisted and shaped balloons you might expect.</p>You stroke your hand along the front of a large, round balloon bear, his simple muzzle shape almost looking happy despite the mouthless, eyeless expression. The big elephant grins, his tusks making his smile stretch in a peculiar manner. \"Impressed, friend? Outlanders often admire Makarna's rubber. It may surprise you, but it is actually formed from the gum of a tree native to our lands! A very useful substance indeed\", he says. He strokes one thick, grey hand down his large and heavy trunk and gives you a wink. \"There is another, more secret way to obtain this material, though. If you are interested!\"</p>You try to tell him that you are not interested, but your voice trails off. You find yourself staring into the smooth, glossy surface of the balloon bear. Your reflection in it is blurry and indistinct, so that you cannot see your own face. Just a generic shape. You are feeling dizzy and strange, and you feel the elephant's powerful arms wrap around your shoulders as he pulls you in deeper to his stall, past the hanging curtains that block off view from the street.</p>He pushes you down onto a pile of comfortable cushions. His store smells pleasantly of incense and thick rubber, which makes you feel even more dizzy and compliant. \"I can always tell good merchandise when I see it. You, I think, would be a very handsome elephant balloon\", he croons in a deep, seductive voice.</p>You find yourself nodding, even as he begins to pull your clothes off. His rough, enormous hands stroke over your body, feeling you and squeezing you gently, like he is measuring you up. Then he begins to rub and massage between your legs, his hands stroking along your crotch, down between your thighs, and up against your rear. Over and over, squeezing and rubbing and stroking. You feel strange, and warm and almost sticky as he continues to touch and feel you. When you try to sit up, he presses you back down into the cushions. You can do nothing but pant and whimper as he shapes and shifts your body, his fingers squeezing and fusing your genitals and rear, as he pushes them up together into one large, tingling sensitive hole between your legs.</p>You feel his massive trunk stroke across your chest. The powerful thick grey limb kissing and teasing along your body, before pushing up under you and sliding into your strange hole. Then, his cheeks inflate, he takes a deep breath, and he starts to blow. His trunk thickens and stiffens as he forces air up into it, and you feel your body grow tight and stretch. Your belly bulges, swelling out and becoming round and taut. Your limbs push out at your sides, and thicken too, while your cheeks swell and you feel lightheaded. Pressure grows inside you, and you feel sure it must blow out your mouth - until you realise your mouth is smooth and sticky, sealed closed. Your whole body feels smooth and glossy and squeaky. Skin becoming flat and featureless and smooth, losing its natural colour to instead take on a golden, honeylike colour. Your limbs getting fatter and losing their definition, hands and feet becoming just bulges with the vague suggestion of their former shape. Your chin and neck become round and chubby, and your face fills with pressure as your jaw and nose push out, slowly stretching into a large, bulbous and stretched out balloon trunk. Your ears wiggle and flop, becoming large cartoonish flaps of rubber, as your eyes and nose seal over with glossy golden rubber, and your insides, and mind, become empty, mindless and happy. Nothing but an empty headed balloon, experiencing floaty pleasure forever.</p>Your shopkeeper ties a pole to your crotch as he withdraws his trunk, and places you out on display with your fellow balloons.",

One by one the people in the front enter, then leave, looking gloomy and holding small pouches of money. Some of the men who enter come out holding their pants up and gritting their teeth.</p>Finally, the guy in front of you enters. He's a tall, muscular Arabian stallion with a long muzzle and sleek white fur. There's just about enough room for two in the building, so you squeeze in behind him to get a closer look.</p>The building is very simple inside. There's a stone wall with a barred window, a small carpet on the ground, and a shelf around crotch height. Behind the window, a very fat hyena wearing golden rings and necklaces is sitting and grinning. When he sees the horse he chuckles. \"Ah, my friend, you return to me again? That gambling problem of yours will make you a mare at this rate. Even a man as blessed as you cannot afford to lose too much more, I think!\", he says.</p>The horse just grunts and pulls down his pants, before taking hold of his heavy eight inch shaft and flopping it onto the counter. The hyena sits up, and starts to stroke and tease his fingers along the horse's shaft. It throbs and twitches, stretching out a little more as it hardens and bulges. Then, the hyena presses one of his rings firmly onto the horse's shaft.  The horse whinnies and shudders, gripping onto the bars of the window as he gasps and shakes. As you watch, his shaft starts to harden and stiffen. The soft flesh becomes smooth and shiny, and the mottled pink and brown colour becomes shiny and gleaming.</p>His cock rounds out, the shape getting more cylindrical, and the head flattening completely.  A golden hue spreads over his cock, and he grunts with a confused mix of discomfort and pleasure, as his dick falls apart, into a stacked pile of golden coins.</p>The horse shudders and lets out a long sigh. \"Just half, please. That should be enough to cover me\", he says. The hyena nods, and very slowly counts out one coin at a time. He strokes his fingers along the stack with each one, and with every one he pulls away, the horse whimpers and twitches his hoof to the ground.</p>Finally, the hyena takes the coins in his hand, and touches the horse's dick with a ring in his other hand. The coins start to soften, the flesh colour returning, and the shape merging together into a throbbing, living, but significantly shorter horse cock. The hyena takes a coin from the pile in his hand and keeps it, before handing the rest back to the horse. The horse then stomps out, his face red and flushed with humiliation.</p>The hyena gives you a wink, and you slip outside behind the horse. Perhaps it's something to keep in mind, if you are ever truly desperate.",
