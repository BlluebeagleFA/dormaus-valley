                        "text": "The reason for your woes gradually become clear as you overhear people whispering about you. Gossips lean towards eachother and point as you walk past, and sometimes you catch people laughing. From the fragments of conversation you catch, it seems that you have cultivated such a bad reputation with your actions that you can't be considered a member of polite society any more.</p>You are trying to figure out how to restore your reputation, when you spot a large carriage on the street. It is black, with bars on the windows, but a colourful painted logo on the side claims it is the \"Gran Campion Reputation Society\". A donkey is sitting atop it, wearing a soft cap and a rough but fashionable set of riding gear. He winks at you.</p>\"Made an ass of yourself, friend? I recognise that look. Worn through people's trust once too many times? Streaked through town, maybe got caught unloading behind a bar alleyway? Well worry no longer! Join me on a trip to the beautiful, the extravagant, city of Gran Campion, and your worries will be solved!\", he says.</p>You ask about Gran Campion, and he pantomimes exaggerated shock and surprise. \"Not heard of the Gilded City? Goodness you really have been living under a rock! I suspected from your appearance, but even so. Gran Campion lies beyond the mountains, the glittering city of canals on the eastern peninsula. The riches of nations flow through her markets, global fashions and tastes are developed in the very heart of culture!\"</p>He hops down, his hoofs tapping as he lands. \"Why, work there for a few months, and you'll be the talk of the town! Everyone will want the news from the Gilded City. I guarantee your reputation as an outcast will be gone!\"</p>With no other options, you reluctantly agree. He leads you into the carriage, and travels on his way. He picks up a few more rough, miserable-looking workers as he travels, all of you with similar stories of embarrassment and shame.</p>The carriage travels a long way, winding through the mountains along a narrow set of passes and roadways. The air becomes cold and dry, and the carriage becomes more uncomfortable by the day. As you make your way back down the mountains, you pass through a checkpoint, and officially enter into the sovereign lands of Gran Campion.</p>The mountains give way to fertile fields, filled with windmills and town houses. Carefully maintained forests are the limits of the \"wild\" on this side of the mountains. The landscape is a patchwork quilt of fields and farms. You pass through small towns, growing larger and more extravagant as you approach the southern coast.</p>Finally, Gran Campion itself appears on the horizon. It is spectacularly huge, a grey blot stretching across your view. The whole city is draped and clouded by mist. Tall towers pierce out from above it, but the buildings below are swaddled by the fog.</p>The road becomes paved and well-maintained as you reach the city gates. The donkey pays a fare, and enters into the city. You travel past tight, cramped streets, with ramshackle houses clustering and fighting for space. Beggars and urchins scramble between foggy roads. Armored guards are everywhere, their black plate wet in the fog. Everywhere, workers and citizens hustle and scramble. The city is packed to bursting, as densely-filled as a rat's warren.</p>The towers rise above it all, piercing into the sky. Despite their beauty, this city stinks of desperation and fear. You and the other 'recruits' are shoved into a squat, cold building. Water drips from the ceiling, and a guttering light illuminates racks of dirty bunkbeds. Welcome to the Work Houses.",

                        "text": "You get the feeling that your most recent crime may have been just a step too far. This feeling is generally exacerbated when you feel someone strike you hard from behind, and cold cuffs locked around your wrists as you pass out.</p>You are awakened some time later with a sore head, by a lurching and jolting motion. You blearily look around and see the wooden boards of some kind of wagon. As you sit up, a clanking sound reveals that you are chained to a bench, by a pair of heavy shackles around your hands. You try on a whim to cast magic, but you feel it fizzle out in your fingers, as the metal shackles seem to somehow ground and steal it. There are other prisoners in the wagon, all of them looking downcast and glum. A raccoon, a fox, and a bear. When you try to ask where you're headed, the fox looks up to you with deep, baggy eyes and gives a weak smile. \"We're being sent to Hornloft, unlucky one. We won't be returning alive\", he says.</p>Over the course of several days, you make short conversation with the other prisoners. Hornloft, you discover, is an infamous prison in the northern kingdom of Horn. The gryphons of Horn believe firmly in retribution, and agree to take the criminals of other lands in exchange for payment. The raccoon and bear were caught in the act of burglary, the bear being a lockpick and the raccoon his muscle. The fox is from the wealthy city of Gran Campion, and was imprisoned for being an anti-monarchist, he claims.</p>Once a day the guards open the barred doors of the wagon and give you all bowls of thin, unpleasant gruel. They are a pair of stoic, muscular canines, and any questions are answered with growls or painful jabs from their batons. The air gets colder and colder as the days pass, making you all shiver and feel weak. Finally, on a day where your breath is crystallizing in the air, the wagon comes to a stop. The door is opened, and the guards pull you out, and lead you chained together through a snowy path.</p>You can tell from the cold, and the thin, painful air, that you are high in the mountains. You pass through dark conifers along a stone-paved path higher and higher, until finally you are led beyond the trees and see your destination. At the edge of a mountain, dangling perilously over the edge, is a massive black fortress. It looms like a sullen beast, with the white snow settling atop it like a shroud. As you walk up the mountainside towards it, you peer down over the edge to see a large city below you, with high thick walls and many dark, squat buildings poking out from between snowy streets.</p>You stop at the entrance to the fortress, in front of a massive mechanical drawbridge. Hornloft itself is built on the edge of a precipice, surrounded on all sides by a sheer drop of cold ice. This drawbridge seems to be the only accessway. The canine guards hand your chains over to two pike-bearing gryphons, wearing dour black armor. They lead you within, and you notice as you enter the narrow passages of the black stone building that it is only barely less bitterly cold than the outside.</p>Your belongings are confiscated, and locked away. You notice they say nothing about ever returning it, or about when or if you will be freed. You are given a grey prison uniform, and taken to a cell high in one of the towers. It is barren and cold, with only a wooden bench, toilet, and a tiny barred window looking out into the steely gray skies.",
