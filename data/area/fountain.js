                        "text": "With Alder nowhere in sight, you decide to search for him yourself. Your efforts seem to be in vain though; he was nowhere to be found. You sat down on a bench and thought you’d wait for him to make his appearance — it couldn’t take too long. Then everything went black… not to mention warm and fuzzy, as a pair of black paws covered your eyes from behind, smelling faintly of smoke.. “Guess who?” a deep, familiar voice spoke out from behind you. You pretend to be deep in thought despite knowing the answer. A few moments later, you utter a name you both knew well — for it was the name of the panther blocking your eyes. You both grin as you hold back from laughing out loud at your shared shenanigans. Alder removes his hands from your face and sits down on the bench right next to you. There’s something different about him; there’s not an inch of leather on his body! Fitting of the sunny weather, he’s wearing a white shirt with blue pants, and his footpaws are out and about for once, free of their confines in leather boots.</p>“Sorry for taking so long. I ended up helping my friend with the morning rush. I did manage to get us some dainties from him though. His pastries are simply magical!” You had to admit that you were pretty hungry. He hands you a croissant and a cinnamon roll and places napkins on your laps. The sudden growlings from your stomaches have you flustered, and you both eat your breakfast in silence. He wasn’t lying, those pastries truly were magical — sating your hunger in an almost mystical manner. Thinking about it, there was only one person in Dormaus capable of producing pastries this good… You were pretty sure who his friend was now.</p>You both take out a cigarette and light it — though you find that your lighter’s gone dead. “Ah, I shouldn’t have given you that old thing. Here.” He took your cigarette and placed it on your lips. “Now inhale,” he said as he joined the tips of your cigarettes together, lighting yours up. You give him a quiet nod, and you both take a deep drag of smoke, allowing it to infiltrate your systems and wash out the stress that had built up all morning.</p>A few people give you strange stares as they walk past you, bothered by the smoke. Smokers were rare in Dormaus, though that was no reason to hold back. People seemed to stay clear of the general vicinity, leaving you to smoke without interruptions. It was nice to take a day off from adventuring and relax. If you could look past the twisted nature of some people, Dormaus was a nice village to live in. The sound of the fountain and birds chirping, alongside the faraway chatter from other villagers, made it easy to close your eyes and enter a meditative state.</p>As you’re about to doze off, someone places a gentle hand on your shoulder and shakes you awake. “It seems you really needed a day off from adventuring,” Alder said as he snickered to himself, “but don’t you think it’d be a waste to spend it snoozing in town?” You admitted that he was right, it’d be a big waste, especially since you had someone to spend the day with. “It’s been a while since I’ve been here during the day. You see, I mostly visit Saberhagen at night and leave before dawn…” he paused for a short moment, “so what I’m saying is… could you show me around Dormaus? You must know the place well by now.” You gave him an approving nod, and you both stood up, half-smoked cigarettes still in your mouths.</p>Dormaus at night had been a truly different thing than what you were used to — was it the same way for him to see Dormaus during the day? You showed him around the town square, telling him about each of the shops and booths you came across. As you walk by the costume store, Alder stops up suddenly and stares at something. At a deeper examination, you see that he’s staring at a black rubber panther costume and a panther mask with a big goofy smile. “I feel like… I’m being mocked, in a way…” the panther said quietly. You, on the other hand, find it pretty cute.</p>“It doesn’t look like me at all!” the panther exclaimed. He was smiling though — he unquestionably found it amusing, even if by proxy of ridiculousness. “Though when you put it that way, it might look good on you…” Alder was about to take a step forward, but he stopped himself. You grabbed his warm hand and dragged him into the store, telling him there might be some other costume inside he’d like better. “You really just want to be a panther like I am, don’t you?” he said in a cheeky tone. You froze up and felt blood rush to your face. You did admire Alder’s physique very much… You shook your head and began dragging him off to the next store to show him around, looking away in hopes that he wouldn’t see your embarrassment.</p>Time flew quickly while you were together, and it was hours past noon before you’d realized. You had to admit you felt quite peckish. You walk around for a while looking for someplace to eat, though for the first time ever it feels like there’s nothing you want to try. Alder pointed at a familiar tent and spoke, “How about Saberhagen’s bakery?” You raised the concern that he was likely already sold out this late in the day. “That is true. Everything was close to being sold out when I had gotten out breakfast…” You point at another stand — a stuffed bun stand. You’d seen it before, but it seemed really arbitrary; why stuff meat inside of the bread when it’d be easier to put it on top of it? Nevertheless, you didn’t have many other options to pick from.</p>Alder walked up to the stand. “Two stuffed pork buns- actually, make that four.” It was at this moment that you realized… you’d forgotten all of your money and valuables at the inn. Quick to notice whatever occurred around you, the panther saw you digging through your pockets frantically, and without even mentioning it, he paid for both of your lunches. You argued that since he had gotten you breakfast, you should at the very least pay him back next time you met. “Don’t worry about it, you’ve been showing me around town all morning. It’s the least I could do.” You weren’t quite satisfied with that, but you couldn’t think of anything to argue with.</p>Eating while walking wasn’t the easiest thing to do, and the bustling streets distracted you from your lunch. The plaza was far away, and the only other quiet place you could think of was… down the river! You urged Alder to follow you, giving him little in terms of answers when he questioned where you would take him. The further you went, the quieter things became until the only sounds left were the sounds of your footsteps and the calm river. You sat down by the riverbed and threw off your shoes, dipping your feet into the cold water; after all that walking today, it felt amazing. Alder sat down next to you, and you began eating your stuffed buns together, chattering idly as you chilled your feet in the river.</p>“These buns are great! It seems like Saberhagen’s got competition.” You had to agree — even if Saberhagen’s pastries were magical, they couldn’t compare to umami of these stuffed buns. While you’d hoped to savor them, you both ended up chowing down on the buns, and they were gone in less than 10 minutes. The rich flavor had you paralyzed for minutes as you processed just how delicious it had been.</p>Today had been a great day so far. You’d had delicious meals, walked around town with a great friend, and now you were sitting with a full stomach by the river with the said friend. As you looked back at the day so far, the panther made his move. In the blink of an eye, he had leaned in close, stealthy like a predator. His lips joined yours, a faint taste of pork lingering on them. Your entire body froze for a moment, then you felt it warm up, your skin tingling as if you’d just returned to a warm fireplace after hours out in the snow. That was right… Today hadn’t just been an ordinary day with a friend. It just came to you — you’d been on a date with Alder.</p>As your lips separated, you stared in awe, unsure how to react. “You can think of that as payment for our lunch.” You just now noticed that, uncharacteristically, his face was just as bright and flushing as your own was. With a stutter, the panther spoke, “if you’d l-like, you can pay your part of the breakfast too…” Without a second thought, you rushed in and kissed him back, spending several seconds interlocked before separating again. You both stared at each other in silence, finding yourselves too flustered to speak.</p>You sat by the river bed for another half an hour or so, quieter than a mouse as you cleaned your feet in the river and smoking a few cigarettes to calm your beating hearts. The more you calmed down, the colder you felt, and your feet began to feel numb. You’d kept your feet in the cold river water for far too long. You try to stand up, keeping one hand on your cigarette so you didn’t drop it. In hindsight, that was a terrible idea… With your feet wet, the already slippery mud by the riverbed gave you no friction. It all went so quickly neither of you could process it before you had already fallen into the river, immediately carried away by the stream. You panicked as the sharp, cold river numbed your entire body, and you felt more helpless than ever before. You could just scarcely see Alder plunging into the river after you; everything went black not long after.",

There are more chuckles from the crowd.</p>\"What about my long tassel tail, slave? Isn't it the most handsome tail you've ever seen?\", he says. You nuzzle your face into his balls and nod happily. Your tailbone stretches and pushes out, growing into a tufted tail just like is. His music rings in your ears, drowning out the sound of the crowd around you.</p>\"How about my fur? Touch it, stroke it, tell me how much better it is than your own body\", he says. You rub your hands up your master's chest, feeling and stroking his thick, soft grey fur, while you tell him how handsome and wonderful and perfect he is. Your own skin tingles and itches, and you feel thick, scruffy grey donkey fur spreading down over you, covering every inch of your body. Your face pushes out into his crotch, as you sniff and nuzzle and kiss him more, your teeth growing larger and goofier, your skull reshaping and changing into a thick donkey muzzle.</p>Your master looks down at you and smiles, and you feel so happy and pleased, your dumb foggy mind all fuzzy and slow and strangely calm. \"Well then slave, if you love my body so much, why don't you give my cock the attention it deserves, and spray yourself down with donkey cum?\", he says. That sounds wonderful! You take hold of his huge long cock, and start to clumsily stroke and squeeze it. Your fingers toughen and harden, turning dark and black and thick. Your feet fuse and stiffen, your toes rounding out and curving as they become large black donkey hooves. Your master's cock is warm and firm and smells wonderful. It starts to ooze and gush thick, slippery pre all over your hands and wrists, and soon begins to pulse and harden with pleasure. Right there, in front of crowds of people, you eagerly open your goofy donkey face and blush with joy, as your master's cock unloads huge gushes of thick, messy donkey cum all over you. It comes out in splattering sprays of hot sticky fluid, spraying over your face, down your chest, and over your arms. It drips from your chin and ears as you wag your butt happily, filled with joy at having been a good pet for your master.",

Next to them, a pair of feet and knees, softer ones, moving back and forth. Ah, a sailor getting some pleasure from a companion. You move on to a main street, and feel the loud clanging clop of four hooves trotting along the stone. A carriage coming in, horse-drawn and bearing fruit from the markets. The hoof trots are a little unsure and clumsy though - this horse probably wasn't a horse this morning. It carries on like this as the mayor uses you to spy on every inch of his village.</p>Finally, he pulls you up from the cobblestone.

A furry body, pressing against your toes, trying to push you up and get free. The mayor presses you down more firmly, forcing the wriggling thing against the carpet.

                        "text": 'Your nose wrinkles as you enter the fountain plaza. The source of the odd odor is immediately evident. A crass dog adventurer uses the fountain as his personal bath, nude in the water. His gear heaped on the ground beside it. The rogue muddies the water as he scrubs his body. A pink bar of soap on a rope tied around his wrist. </p>You watch the rogue brazenly clean himself in the public fountain. It leaves you to wonder if it will ever be a pristine spectacle again. The musky dog doesn\'t seem to care who is watching or what he effects. He uses the soap to scrub his body clean, focused solely on himself.</p>As he washes his body you begin to notice something he doesn\'t. As the brown dirt washes away, his greyish fur is revealed. One more rinse and you see the fur get lighter. He soaps his whole body and then slops in the water, dunking himself in. With his eyes closed he doesn\'t notice that his fur is turning...pink.</p>That isn\'t the only change. The mutt\'s muzzle has become more slender. His sleek thin tail frizzes out, as if when dry it would be bushy. You bit your lip as the dog hums and soaps his hefty sheath and balls. You owe the crass dog no favors, let him find out himself. You watch him massage his junk, a thick cock starting to slip free. He is a fine specimen of a male. </p>Until he dives back under the water.</p>You have to stifle a laugh. A male dog dove under the water, but what rose out was a beautiful vixen. Wide hips, feminine features, all on a sleek body. To make things worse, the vixen\'s fur was a bright unmistakable pink. A soft feminine mix of pink, creamy underbelly, with dark black gloves.</p>A satisfied moan rose up from the vixen\'s throat. The demure sultry moan enough to make her open her own eyes. She grasped her perky bosoms, he eyes went wide as saucers. An exploring paw slipped down between her legs, confirming for the roguish hound what he had become.</p>"No...no....NO!" She shrieked, fingering her tight new pussy, "Where is that fox who sold me this shit, I\'ll make him pay!"</p>You can only shake your head at the scene. It only confirms your suspicion what had caused the change, and where it had come from. You consider following the angry vixen, but you suspect you already know the outcome of that too.</p>A well bred vixen would soon be stumbling out of the merchant\'s tent wearing a free t-shirt. Probably reading something along the lines of, "Another satisfied customer!" [Guest event from Fahlma]',

He\'s cranking a hand organ, and making a rather janky, unpleasant tune from it. A human walks past and tells him to shut up that racket, and the monkey grins and tosses the organ over to him. </p>The human blinks with surprise, before he starts to grip and turn the organ handle. The monkey, meanwhile, takes two wooden X shapes in his hand-like feet. Strings emerge from the wood, and wrap around the human\'s limbs like a puppet. The human starts to dance as he turns the organ, and his body begins to shrink, leaving his armor oversized and ridiculous. His face pushes forward into a rounded muzzle, and his ears grow huge and round. A small tail emerges from his rear, before his flesh starts to become hard and firm. His elbows clank and clink, becoming wooden joints, while his face stretches into a fixed smile. Soon, the monkey man is manipulating a small wooden monkey puppet, just a mindless toy playing a silly little song.',
