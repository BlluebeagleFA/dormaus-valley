They scuttle away, annoyed.</p></p>Then your hands hit something big under the sand. You dig around it, slowly revealing a huge wooden chest, still locked and sealed. Jackpot!</p></p>You pull it firmly, and the rusted lock eventually gives way with a snap. Inside are dozens of bags, each filled with coins! This must be worth a fortune!</p></p>Something splashes down over your face, soaking your head. You jump back in shock, the stink of it stinging your nostrils. It smells fruity, and extremely alcoholic.</p></p>You were so distracted by your loot, you hadn't noticed someone coming up behind you. You look up to see a shark, still dripping with water. He must have just come out of the sea only a moment ago.</p></p>He's wearing nothing but a pair of dark skintight pants that look like a cross between leather and fish scales, and a bandolier across his muscular chest which is keeping a long spear strapped to his back. His bare feet are splayed across the sand, almost lizardlike except that he has dark blue shark skin instead of scales.</p></p>He grins, and lifts one huge foot, before stomping it down on the chest and closing it.</p></p>\"I'll be taking that, mate. All salvage treasure belongs to the sea, don't ya know?\"</p></p>His voice is rough and gravelly, suiting his scarred and brutish appearance. You feel like you should protest and resist, but something seems odd. Your vision is blurry, and the shark seems to split double and sway in front of your eyes. You shake your head, but just feel dizzier. You hiccup, your face flushed and a dumb smile on your face.</p></p>\"Aye, looks like shark grog works quick on you, eh?\", he says.</p></p>You nod, not really sure what you're agreeing with. The shark licks his lips, and you notice a tent bulging slightly in his crotch through his strange pants.</p></p>\"Take off your clothes, land-walker\", he growls. Your swaying hands grab your shirt as you pull it up over your head, struggling to strip yourself. You hear a rumbling from him, and he starts to stroke his crotch as he watches you.</p></p>\"With each thing you pull off, part of your mind goes with it. Dropping that shirt, you're forgetting who you are. Sliding down those pants, you don't remember anyone you've met before. There's only me.\"</p></p>You nod, obeying instinctively. As your shirt hits the ground, your head feels more empty, your memories fading away. You step out of your pants, and can't remember anyone else in the world existing apart from this huge, looming shark. He steps forward, grabbing your leg and pulling off your shoes.</p></p>\"Forgetting everything. All your mind, your personality, your thoughts. I'm taking them all away. You are empty. You know nothing. You only obey...\"</p></p>You nod, your thoughts getting slower, more obedient. Your will crumbles as he strokes your bare feet, leaving you naked, helpless, utterly at his mercy.</p></p>\"Now you have nothing. You are completely empty. Totally mindless and obedient\", he growls. You nod. You are empty. Obedient. Mindless. Completely at his will.</p></p>He pushes you down on your back on the wet sand, and his huge foot presses down on your chest. The webs between his toes press wetly against your skin, as he stands over you, pulling down his pants to reveal two enormous, throbbing cocks standing fully erect from his crotch.</p></p>\"I'm going to give you something now. Because you are empty, and meaningless without me, got it? So by doing this, there'll be nothing in you except what I've given ya.\"</p></p>You nod, your head still swimming and confused. You watch as he grabs his fat cocks in both hands, stroking them and pumping them. Hot pre dribbles from the tips, splashing onto your chest as he pumps faster, thrusting his crotch and snarling as both his cocks bulge and swell, getting harder, thicker.</p></p>Finally, he roars, and two hot streams of white cum erupt from his shafts. The jizz arcs in the air, then splatters over your face, musky and thick and warm. He pants, as you shudder, feeling the cum drip down your face.</p></p>\"There. You've got nothin', but now you've got my cum. That's the deepest part of your mind, savvy? My pleasure, my lust. That's your most important thought, what drives you, what makes you want to do anything.\"</p></p>You nod, your mind filling with need. As he lifts his foot, you instinctively lean forward, kissing it and tasting the sand and salty ocean water on his sole. He pulls his foot away, and you lean forward, pressing your face against his cocks, feeling their warmth bounce against your cheeks. You lick the dripping cum from them, but he pushes you away.</p></p>\"Get dressed, landwalker\", he says with a grin. You nod, feeling desperately that you have to obey. As you pull your clothes back on, ignoring your own overwhelming arousal, your mind slowly returns. The groggy drunkenness fades, and soon you are feeling back to normal.</p></p>That treasure is yours. You found it first!</p></p>\"I want that treasure\", he says.</p></p>\"Yes sir! It's all yours!\", you blurt out. Your cheeks flush. You shiver with desire. Making this shark happy is the most important thing in the world. He reaches over and picks it up, lifting the heavy chest effortlessly.</p></p>\"You love pirates like me, landwalker. Your biggest fantasy is making a rough, filthy pirate happy. Isn't that right?\"</p></p>Instantly your body reacts. You nod, wanting to kiss him, to lick him, to feel and hug and obey him forever.</p></p>He laughs at you, and pushes you over into the sand as you lean forward to touch him.</p></p>\"Bring me more treasure next time, my horny little guppy. If you do, maybe I'll let you kiss my behind\"</p></p>Before you can scramble out of the sand, he's walked back into the water, and out of sight. You are left panting and blushing, your head filled with an overwhelming need to be some filthy pirate's bitch.",

You feel like you could wander through the desert like this forever. Like this is where you were meant to be. You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you. Why do you even need clothes? You are better off without them.</p></p>You pull off your shirt and pants, tossing aside your protection from the sun. As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

Sand tumbles from its surface as it stares at you.</p></p>\"Give...me...\"</p></p>You feel weak all over, your body aching as the eyes glow. Your supplies and treasure fall from your hands, as you fall forward onto your knees.</p></p>\"Give...life...\"</p></p>Your hands hit the sand, and your body feels numb, and heavy. You feel stiff all over, barely able to move a muscle. Weight presses down on you, making your hands and knees sink into the shifting sand.</p></p>Your skin starts to harden, growing rough and firm.

Another adventurer out of his element, eh?\"</p></p>A pair of feather-fingered hands reach down, and start patting over you. They slide into your pockets, and take your belongings. You try to look up, and see a stocky bird, with a long featherless pink neck and a long vicious beak. The feathers at the base of his neck are ruffled out like a collar.</p></p>\"Not bad, some juicy goods here. Many thanks, lunch! I'll get myself a real nice price for one of these!\"</p></p>The vulture grins at you, and lifts his foot. His talon presses over your face, turning your head left and right as he looks down at you. You hear his stomach growl, but you are too weak to do anything at all.</p></p>He sits on your chest, and props his thick claws either side of your head. It's like being sat on by a particularly heavy pillow. He flexes his talons, and presses them to your cheeks, before rubbing your face and squeezing your head in the grip of his long avian toes.</p></p>It's oddly soothing. Your thirst and pain seems to fade away. He turns his feet, forcing you to look up into his eyes. Above him, the harsh sun glares down at you, but you barely notice. You just see the grin of that happy vulture, his bright eyes. It feels soothing, calm, happy.</p></p>\"You wanna be my lunch, bud? Want me to eat you, make me a happy stuffed vulture?\"</p></p>You do. You want to help this nice bird. He's taking all the pain away. He's soft and warm and handsome. Just a nice, friendly bird.</p></p>His beak opens wide, and leans down. You feel his tongue slide across your face, the wonderful moisture making you want to sigh. Your head presses up into his throat, so dark and cool and comfortable compared to the desert. Even if you had the strength to resist, you wouldn't. It feels so good, to have your shoulders and chest swallowed up, your body pressed into the vulture's gullet. To sink deep into the darkness, and slide down into his belly, curled up and warm and happy.</p></p>Nothing but vulture food.",
