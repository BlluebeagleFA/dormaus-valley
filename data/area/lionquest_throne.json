After she and the other hyenas are guided away by guards, the original guard returns and leads you back to the harem. He looks disappointed, and annoyed. You ask him what is wrong, and he is surprised to see a harem slave speaking for themselves. \"Leonar is...a difficult king. His father was just and kind. I hope that one day my king will be as great as he was\", he says. He then bows, and leaves you be.",
