You scavenge small plants, find easier paths between dunes, and at one point even walk beneath the shadow of a small cloud for over a mile before it disappears.</p></p>In fact, you don't even feel sore, or tired. You feel like you could wander through the desert like this forever. Like this is where you were meant to be. You climb to the top of a dune, and look out across the desert, seeing it stretch from horizon to horizon. An infinity of heat and dust, your kingdom, your territory.</p></p>Something inside you feels hot and intense. You shudder, stretching up and feeling the sun bear down on you. Why do you even need clothes? You are better off without them.</p></p>You pull off your shirt and pants, tossing aside your protection from the sun. As you do, you notice your body seems bigger, stronger. Not so much bulging with muscle, but lean and powerful, like a predator.</p></p>You flex your hands, and notice your palms are thicker and rounder than before. Dark brown pads cover them, and when you lift your feet, you notice you have them there too. Oddly, this doesn't seem unnatural. It just makes it easier to walk on the hot sand.</p></p>You leap down from the dune, before landing on all fours and bounding across the desert. Running like this feels freeing, natural. Your muscles bulge and heave, sweat drips down your flanks. As you run, your spine begins to change, stretching out and growing. It thickens into a long tail behind you, the weight of it making it easier for you to run, to glide across the sand. At the end of your thick, muscular tail, sharp fins stretch out, capable of cutting through solid rock. A think layer of brown-grey fur begins to cover your naked body, reflecting the heat and making you feel even more at home.</p></p>You snort, your head feeling larger, heavier, but your mind feeling oddly small. When you open your mouth, it stretches into a muzzle, revealing massive fangs. You shake your head, and the weight grows heavier, as thick horns push forward from your temples, and curve up in front of you. A thick mohawk of tough fur bristles from your head and down your powerful neck.</p></p>Yes, you are a true beast of the desert. The heat and sand is no danger to you. You are a danger to everything else!</p>",

You feel stiff all over, barely able to move a muscle. Weight presses down on you, making your hands and knees sink into the shifting sand.</p></p>Your skin starts to harden, growing rough and firm. It becomes craggy and rocky, all colour in your body being replaced by the orange-yellow of sandstone. Your hands fuse into lumps of rock, your insides seize up and petrify into stone. Finally, the features on your head fade over, your whole body becoming a lump of messy, weathered stone, indistinguishable from any other normal boulder in the desert.</p></p>The sandstorm slowly fades, and the rocky creature's eyes seem brighter and more alert.

It's hard to make out the cobra's side of the conversation, but from the yelling the jackal is doing, it seems the snake is trying to pay the other merchant less than what they had previously agreed on. All of a sudden, the jackal starts to grow quiet and sluggish, simply staring at the cobra as they softly hiss to their companion. After about a minute of this, the Jackal seems to become more alert again, and no longer appears upset over the decrease in pay. As the two go their separate ways, so do you, deciding whatever just happened was none of your business. (Contributed by legotron123)",
