                "text":"Over the next few days, you accompany Kristoph in his journey and lifestyle. He shows you how to dig holes in the ice and fish, how to find shelter in the frozen steppes, and how to care for the reindeer. The reindeer themselves are able to seek out what little grass and greenery is available this far north, and as you travel further and further south, more snow-covered trees and rolling hills start to come into view.</p>The routine is repetitive and simple, but calming. While Kristoph mans the reins, you ride in the sled and help darn clothes or brush the furs. Once you stop, you have meals of milk or fish, sitting with the older man in a ring of reindeer. Their thick smell starts to feel comforting and warm once you get used to it.</p>Then it's time to check on the reindeer, brush them, and make sure their hooves and antlers are healthy. Sometimes Kristoph will have you help him gather plants from under the snow or you will wait at a hole for fish, and then more travelling. By night, he sets up a small tent and you sleep close to him, his huge powerful body pressed against yours and keeping you warm.</p>As you are helping Kristoph brush and milk one of the reindeer one day, you notice mountains rising up to the south, just starting to be visible from your current position. Kristoph stands up, a bucket of milk in his hand, and wipes frost from his forehead. \"Looks like we're getting close now. That's the start of the Horn mountains. They carry on south for a long way down the big valley. Looks like our journey will be ending soon\", he says.</p>You feel a little sad at that. While this life was simple and quiet, you were starting to get used to it. The day after you spot the mountains, Kristoph pulls the sled up next to a snow-covered wooden building. An old lady pulls open a shutter and peeks out. \"Kristoph, dear? Is that you? I haven't seen you in over a year!\", she says. He nods to her, and then picks you up in his massive arms and carries you over to the post, smiling as he does. \"I have some very important post, Granny\", he says with a chuckle, before placing you down.</p>He and the old lady catch up briefly, and then he gives you a brief, tight hug. \"Travel safely. Promise me you will not stop until you return to your safe little village, friend\", he says. You nod, and he mounts back into his sled and turns to leave. The old lady pats your hand and pulls you into the building next to the fire.</p>Later that day, the mail carriage arrives, and you climb aboard the back with the small number of letters and post that need to travel south. It is a long, bumpy ride down south, and for most of it you carefully hide under the canvas sheets to avoid the eyes of guards and officials in the Horn area. The mailman ignores this behaviour, presumably used to people staying clear of gryphon guards.</p>Weeks later, after travelling down mountain paths, forests, and long fields, you finally return to Dormaus Village.",

Small lanterns are hanging from the doors of each house, so you can find your way even as the long dark night draws in. He walks past the first two houses, towards one with a flickering red light in the lantern.</p>When he taps on the door, it is answered by a young child. The boy appears human, but to your slight surprise, his bare feet end in large, flat hooves. He takes Kristoph's gloved hand and pulls him inside, and you follow. The house is very small, with furs on the floor and a small hearth burning. A woman is tending to a man lying in bed, who's breathing is ragged and pained. She looks up with teary eyes. \"Kristoph! You came! Please, Erik was hurt badly by a falling tree. He needs your help\", she says.</p>Kristoph nods and pulls his gloves off, something you have seen him do only once before. He places his hands gently on the man's head, then strokes down his body, moving in small circles like he is looking for something. He then nods and presses his palm firmly on the man's lower chest, before closing his eyes.</p>Slowly, the man's pained breathing becomes calmer and more even. His clenched hands relax and open up as he sighs in relief. You are surprised to see something else, though. Two bumps are forming on his head, starting to grow and bulge out. They push out through the skin, stretching taller and arching above his head. When they bump against the headboard, he grunts and sits up, before reaching up to feel the bony protrusions as they split and grow into branching white antlers. Kristoph pulls his hand away, and nods. \"You are well, now. I would advise greater care when chopping trees in future, Erik, unless you want to join the herd early\", he says.</p>Erik laughs and shivers, before lying back down to rest and sleep. The rest of the family thank Kristoph profusely, and the mother gives you a large bag of preserved food before you go on your way.</p>He checks on the other houses before you go, but no one else needs anything more than a brief touch on the forehead for a chill. As you return to the sled, he explains. \"I have the healing hands, but it does come at a price. A child is born rarely in these steppes who's touch can heal any wound or injury, at the cost of humanity itself. Anyone I touch will slowly become a healthy, ordinary reindeer. The people of the villages here accept that as a way of life. They know when they grow old they will join my herd and live out their twilight years as simple beasts. This is why I couldn't let you touch me. My face is safe enough, but anywhere else and you would join our herds too early, my friend\", he says.</p>You give that some thought as you walk back to the sled.",

You reach down, stroking across his strong round belly, and begin to pull on the laces of his tunic again. Once again he stops you, but this time you tell him that you understand the risk, and you want this.</p>He thinks carefully for a moment, then squeezes you. \"I want this too. I will do everything I can to ensure you don't go all the way\", he says, his voice deep and needy. He sits up and reaches down, pulling on his thick leather boots, slowly revealing the wide strong feet within. You lean down and pull off his damp, musky socks to see his large, muscular bare feet. The tops are dusted with soft white hair, and you squeeze and massage his soles, making him grunt and sigh with delight.</p>His cheeks redden under his beard, and he starts to pull off his tunic. \"I haven't been touched for a very long time\", he rumbles</p>As you squeeze and stroke his feet, you feel your own toes start to stiffen and feel hard. The skin there darkens, and your toes begin to merge and fuse together, clacking as they become hooves. He takes your wrists and pulls you up away from his feet, and you slide your hands into his unfastened tunic and pull it up over his head. His huge round belly is bare, and covered in curly white hair. You stroke and massage it, lifting and squeezing into it as you press yourself into his warm body. His pecs are chubby but firm, with extra thick fur that you press your face into as he hugs you tightly. You feel tingling on your own chest and face, and he pulls you up and kisses you. His gloved hand strokes across your chest as it slowly becomes furry and soft and shaggy, and you feel your face beginning to push out, the bones reshaping and shifting into a muzzle.</p>He finally pushes down his pants, tugging them down off his wide strong legs, and kicking them away. His crotch is covered in a thick furry forest of soft white hair, from which his large hairy balls and his fat, heavy cock stand proud and firm. Slowly, and hesitantly, he pulls off his gloves and places them aside, then pulls you up onto him so that your bare chest is against his own. He shudders in pleasure as he strokes and squeezes you, and you start to kiss and rub against his chest. Your hands stiffen, your fingers becoming firm and hard as the tips turn brown and hooflike. More fur spreads up your arms and down your legs, becoming thicker and shaggier.</p>You get down on your knees, and press your growing face into Kristoph's musky, furry crotch. You kiss and lick along his balls, rubbing and pressing yourself firmly against him. He shudders and gasps, his fat uncut cock oozing and twitching as pre dribbles and gushes out from the swollen head. Some of the pre drips onto your growing furry muzzle, and the scent of it drives you wild with need. You open your mouth and take his cock inside, sucking and tasting it eagerly. Your nose darkens and widens as it becomes a soft, sensitive reindeer nose, buried deep in Kristoph's hairy crotch. You feel his wide cock stretch your jaw and bounce in the back of your throat as he thrusts and presses into you.</p>You feel your head aching and pulsing, as hard nubs start to form. They stretch and bulge, growing larger and wider, before they burst from your head and arch up. Bony new antlers splitting and growing, forming a strange weight atop your head. Kristoph holds onto them and thrusts firmly into your mouth, using them like handlebars as his cock pounds into your throat.</p>He pulls you up, and presses you down onto the furs. You snort, your ears getting longer and furrier, and your body almost completely covered in fur. He lifts your legs up, holding them under his armpits as he guides his hard, dripping cock to your rear. With a firm, powerful thrust, he pushes it into your hole, and you gasp in pleasure. Your insides stretch out against the older man's girthy cock, and you feel every inch of it as it slides into you and fills you. He thrusts and pounds into your ass, while you feel your tailbone stretch and grow furry, becoming a fuzzy reindeer tail. Finally, he moans and pants and grunts, shuddering with lust. His massive hairy belly bounces and wobbles, as he growls and thrusts in hard and deep. You feel his hot, thick cum rush up inside you, and your own hard cock follows suit, spraying down your chest with musky dripping reindeer cum.</p>He sighs with relief, before pulling out, and backing away gently. \"That was incredible. Thank you, it was a wonderful experience. I only wish I could kiss every inch of your beautiful body, but I fear any further touch would leave you nothing more than a beast\", he says sadly. You nod, still awash with the afterglow, and keep a careful distance as he puts his clothes back on. That night you dream of spending your life at Kristoph's side, pulling his sled and being one of his beloved herd.</p>The following morning, Kristoph squeezes you firmly to him in a hug. \"I think it is time for you to head home, my friend. I have loved our time together but I would not forgive myself if you were to become a simple animal because of me\", he says.</p>You understand, but part of you wants to stay here forever. Perhaps one day you will return and show him you have chosen to be a reindeer of your own free will.",

Some of the pre drips onto your growing furry muzzle, and the scent of it drives you wild with need. You open your mouth and take his cock inside, sucking and tasting it eagerly. Your nose darkens and widens as it becomes a soft, sensitive reindeer nose, buried deep in Kristoph's hairy crotch. You feel his wide cock stretch your jaw and bounce in the back of your throat as he thrusts and presses into you.</p>You feel your head aching and pulsing, as hard nubs start to form. They stretch and bulge, growing larger and wider, before they burst from your head and arch up. Bony new antlers splitting and growing, forming a strange weight atop your head. Kristoph holds onto him and thrusts firmly into your mouth, using them like handlebars as his cock pounds into your throat.</p>He pulls you up, and presses you down onto the furs. You snort, your ears getting longer and furrier, and your body almost completely covered in fur. He lifts your legs up, holding them under his armpits as he guides his hard, dripping cock to your wet, needy pussy. With a firm, powerful thrust, he pushes it inside you, and you gasp in pleasure. Your insides stretch against the older man's girthy cock, and you feel every inch of it as it slides into you and fills you. He thrusts and pounds into you, while you feel your tailbone stretch and grow furry, becoming a fuzzy reindeer tail. Finally, he moans and pants and grunts, shuddering with lust. His massive hairy belly bounces and wobbles, as he growls and thrusts in hard and deep. You feel his hot, thick cum rush up inside you, and your whole body flushes with warmth and heat as a rush of orgasmic bliss fills you.</p>He sighs with relief, before pulling out, and backing away gently. \"That was incredible. Thank you, it was a wonderful experience. I only wish I could kiss every inch of your beautiful body, but I fear any further touch would leave you nothing more than a beast\", he says sadly. You nod, still awash with the afterglow, and keep a careful distance as he puts his clothes back on. That night you dream of spending your life at Kristoph's side, pulling his sled and being one of his beloved herd.</p>The following morning, Kristoph squeezes you firmly to him in a hug. \"I think it is time for you to head home, my friend. I have loved our time together but I would not forgive myself if you were to become a simple animal because of me\", he says.</p>You understand, but part of you wants to stay here forever. Perhaps one day you will return and show him you have chosen to be a reindeer of your own free will.",

It is very rare, even here where the magic is strong and wild. Sometimes I will visit the little villages and use my healing, in exchange for a little food or trinkets and so forth.

But it sounds like very bad news to me. My advice would be to stay away from the steppes in future. Some people are born more sensitive to spirits and fey creatures and are always in danger of getting too close. Could be that you got in touch with something very unpleasant.\""
