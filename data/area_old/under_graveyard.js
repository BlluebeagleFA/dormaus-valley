The creature lands against one wall, and then leaps down to another, zig-zagging across the pit until it lands safely on the ground. You are deposited on the floor, and you hear a strange, crunching twisting sound. Bonacieux\'s torch lights up with a whoosh of air, and you look over to see no sign of a massive beast. Instead, he is just buttoning up his armour, which had burst open. \"I lost my supplies in the fall, I\'m afraid. We will have to take greater caution as we proceed.\"",

The breastplate is forced over your chest, and the rusty helmet slides over your head. Your vision swims and you feel dizzy. You hear Bonacieux\'s concerned voice as you seem to slip away into a dream.</p></p>You awaken with a snort. Your head is aching like crazy. You must have drank too much with the other guards again. You\'re getting too old to keep doing that. You reach up, and massage your wide chubby jowls with your thick furry hoof-hand. For a brief moment, you think something looks off about it, but you put that down to just an effect of your hangover. You heave yourself up, your huge furry brown gut hanging below you, as you wander over to the mirror in the guard tower.</p>You look the same as usual. Bit older, maybe. A heavy, stocky brown boar, with a wide pink snout, and grey streaks in your thick bristly fur. You scratch your chin and yawn, showing off your huge tusks. You fish around for your helmet, and pull it on over your head. You quite like how your tusks nicely curve out around the frame of the helmet. Keeps all the new recruits in their place being able to see what a big powerful man their sergeant is. You turn, and look out through the arrow-slit window in the side of the stone tower. Dormaus is bustling along as always, across the hills and past the river. The kingdom is growing so fast these days. New cottages are sprouting up faster than weeds. The king expanded the castle twice in two decades, when it hadn\'t changed for hundreds of years before that.</p>You are distracted by a knocking on your door. You snort with annoyance, and stomp over to open it up. Standing beyond is a very nervous young fox. He\'s dressed in the blue and white striped tunic that all new recruits get before they\'ve shown they can be trusted with armor. \"Private, you better have a damn good reason for bothering me before the sun is even up\", you growl at him. He gulps and hops from one foot to the other. His feet are bare, and dirty. Probably used to be a farmboy before joining the guard. You can tell by his thin, but toned arms and that slender underfed body that barely fits the tunic. Your cock shifts a little in your pants, and you adjust it with your hoofed hand. He definitely notices. \"I, um, sir, I was told it was, um, that I have to clean the sergeant\'s room, er, sir\", he stammers.</p>You grin. There\'s no such requirement. Someone is hazing the lad, hoping you\'ll give him a tongue-lashing and a clip around the ear. You have something else in mind though. \"I got something you can clean, boy\", you say. You grab his arm and pull him inside, then lock the door. He stumbles on the mess of clothes you\'ve left on the floor, but when he looks at your grin, he starts to blush. He reaches down to the buttons on his tunic, waiting for your permission, and you give him a nod. He unbuttons, and pulls it off, revealing his thin, furry chest. Then he pushes down his pants to show off his erect, throbbing cock, rising up from the pale fur of his crotch. Maybe he wasn\'t sent up here after all. Looks like someone has been hoping to serve the sergeant.</p>You push him over to the bed, and reach down into your pants, pulling out your thick, musky boar cock. He rolls over, and lifts his rear, his huge fluffy brush tail wagging and moving. You grip his slender sides with your rough trotter hands, and press your cockhead to his hole. He shakes a little, and whines. \"Sergeant Phil, p-please breed me!\", he whimpers.</p></p>You grunt. Something isn\'t right. You so badly want to fuck this needy little bitch\'s hole. But...that isn\'t your name. This...isn\'t your body! You back away, and he turns with surprise. \"Sergeant?\", he says. You faintly hear an echoing voice. Bonacieux. He\'s shouting you. You growl, and slide your hand down your fat, furry body. Feeling, your eyes closed. Past your fat gut, your thick legs. There! A slimy, ghostly little tendril. You squeeze and rip it free, then toss it away.</p></p>When you open your eyes, you\'re back in the catacombs. Back in your body. You crawl through quickly, and look around. What the fuck was that?

Something faintly in the back of your head tells you that something is wrong, but you ignore it. You are Sergeant Phil, the big horny boar. Don\'t overthink it. You ram your cock forward, feeling it stretch the fox\'s tight hole. Damn, but this guy might even be a virgin! You push in deeper, as his hot little ass wiggles and pushes against you. Your thick cock feels amazing penetrating inside him, and his little whines and whimpers of needy pleasure make you feel like a big, tough man. Your huge musky bear balls slap against his ass as you fuck him faster and harder. Can\'t go easy on the recruits after all.</p>Someone seems to be calling your name outside. You ignore it. What an annoyance. You\'re trying to have fun here! You block out the sound, and stroke your rough hands down the fox\'s slender back. You lean forward, and breathe your thick, smoky breath against his neck. He shivers and blushes more, his own cock leaking pre all over your bed. Finally, you grunt, and snarl as you feel your fat cock pulse inside him, and unload thick, hot loads of boar batter deep into his little slut ass.</p></p>You are sinking deeper into your pleasure, loving the warm musky rush of your usual hour-long boar orgasm flooding over you, when you feel an annoying stinging sensation in your cheeks. You growl, and shake your head, before blearily opening them. There is a grey wolf standing over you, with magical implements scattered all around him. In his hand, he\'s holding some sort of weird black worm. It glows and sizzles as he disintegrates it. \"Are you alright? You seemed to pass out, and you\'ve been muttering something in your sleep\", he says. You blink with confusion.  Bonacieux. The old wolf is  Bonacieux. You...are not Sergeant Phil. But some of him has remained on you. You look down to see that your belly is bulging and rounder than it was before, and your voice feels a little deeper and rougher. Clearly you\'re going to have to be more careful down here.",
