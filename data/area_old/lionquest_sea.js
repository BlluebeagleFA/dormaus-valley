You lick the sweat from inside, and lie back to feel his dirty boot resting over your face. He turns around, and grunts with surprise to see you eagerly nuzzling and shoving your face into his boots. "Stowaway! What are you doing?!", he demands. You try to stammer an explanation, but he grabs his footwear and kicks you out of the cabin.</p>After that, you get a reputation for being a paw slut. One chubby wolf pirate is swabbing the deck when he sees you, and he makes you get on your hands and knees and lick the dirt from the bottom of his wide, sweaty paws. The rat who sleeps on the hammock above you dangles his pink paws over the edge, and tells you to clean up the dirt from the day. You suck on his firm rough toes and lick his claws clean. Soon you\'re begging for the pirates to walk all over you and shove their feet on your face and belly, an experience that you find incredibly arousing, but also rather painful.',

A massive tail thrashes behind him, and in his mouth is a huge fish...from which your line is emerging. "This. Is. Mine.", he says, in a slow, deep voice. You gulp as he takes a step towards you.

Learn.", he says. You are helpless to resist as he shoves himself into you, thrusting deep and slamming in and out. His body drips seawater onto you, and pins you down under his rock-hard muscle and rough, hard skin. His breathing gets faster and harder as he pounds you more and more, until finally he growls and roars, unloading cum in two forceful blasts inside you.

You are bruised and battered, and you pass out on the deck, falling unconscious as the ship sways beneath you. The pirates, worried about you, pick you up and carry you to the captain\'s cabin, where they rest you on his bed. You pass in and out of consciousness, only distantly aware of what they\'re talking about. "Found em passed out next to the mop bucket, cap\'n!", the chubby wolf says. A rat touches your forehead and makes a concerned noise. "Ain\'t gonna last much longer like this, captain. Can you do anything?", the rat says. The captain looks you over and shakes his head. "I\'m no healer, swabbies. Didn\'t bring any hoodoo onto the ship either. We can either accept losing our friend here to the cruel sea, or...we can try a spirit replacement", he says.</p>The pirates talk and argue about it for a while. With spirit replacement they could heal your injuries and make you better able to handle the journey, but your old life would be over. They\'d be calling on the essence of the ship to completely erase your old personality, replacing your memories, body and identity with that of a lifelong pirate. They don\'t want to do it, but in the end they decide that it\'s better than letting you die.</p>They start the ritual by removing all of your clothes, and taking your belongings. The chubby wolf packs them all up into a chest, and heaves it over the edge of the ship. The crew then dresses you up in new clothing, a piece from each of them. The chubby wolf pulls off his sweat-soaked bandana and ties it around your head. Another wolf drops his pants and pushes the dirty, rough material up over your legs, while two rats donate a cheap vest with all the buttons missing, and a pair of boots that are open at the toes. Finally, the captain pulls out an old cutlass he hasn\'t used in years, and ties it onto the sash around your new pants.</p>Your body starts to shift and change, moving and altering itself to fit the clothes. Your ears grow and push up, sliding under the headband and then over it, before growing large and round. Your face pushes forward, stretching into a pointed muzzle, before sprouting crooked, thin white whiskers. In the boots, your feet begin to stretch. Your toes grow longer, your soles toughen and harden like you\'ve been working on the high seas your whole life, and you grow short, sharp claws. A tail emerges from the hole in the back of your pants, growing longer and thicker as it snakes down the bed and along your leg, becoming a long rat\'s tail.</p>In your dreaming state, you find yourself recalling old memories. Something\'s not right, though. You can\'t seem to remember where you grew up. Instead, your memories are mixed and shuffled together with new ones. You remember being a kid on the streets of Makarna, an unwanted street rat. Captain Rock cuffed you when you tried to pick his pocket, but he took pity on you and took you to his ship to teach you to be a cabin boy.</p>Your memories of school and growing up are being crowded out by all the things you learned on Rook\'s ship. How to use a sword, and how to climb rigging and repair a sail. Hours upon hours of swabbing decks and cooking food for the rude and crude pirates. Also, though, the camaraderie and companionship of your shipmates, and trusting in the captain to look after you and do what\'s best.</p>You start to scratch at your skin in your sleep, feeling your hands become longer and rougher. You grow scruffy, dirty rat fur all over your body, and you squeak and moan as your mind and spirit feels confused and strange. You remember the cute fat wolf pirate, Barker. He had a crush on you, and you hooked up with him in the brig once, losing your virginity and taking his as you kissed his nervous muzzle and tasted his thick cock. The quiet gloomy tall rat Jericho, who taught you how to cheat at cards and thought of you as a little brother. The time you saved the captain during a boarding party, when an enemy pirate was about to stab him in the back, and you struck someone down for the first time with a knife in the back.</p>Outside, the other pirates get dizzy too, their own memories shifting to take you into them, the spirit of the ship changing the world to make you part of this one. You jerk awake, and sit up, looking around at the familiar confines of the captain\'s cabin. You ask what the fuck you\'re doing in here, and everyone looks equally confused about what just happened. The captain takes charge and orders everyone to get back to work. For a moment he looks at you curiously, before his expression is replaced by that mixture of stern leadership and fatherly affection you\'re used to.

You would call an alarm, but somehow you feel like you know this man, even though you are certain you\'ve never met before. The bat turns to you and smiles with his gleaming fangs. "Hello friend! Got yourself into trouble again, I see?", he says. You blink at him in confusion, and tell him you\'ve never met.</p>He hops up onto the deck and bows to you, doffing his hat as you do so. You are so surprised by his actions that you don\'t react in time when he suddenly moves forward and wraps his wings around you like a cloak. You yell and shove and push at him, until suddenly you fall forward onto the deck. The bat is gone, but more bizarrely, your body is no longer that of a rat. You are back to your old self, like none of it ever happened.',

You turn to see a sailor leaning on the side of the deck next to you. He\'s a wolf, his fur thick and shaggy, with big paws and a long but chubby snout, going with his round belly that peeks out from under his striped shirt. He stinks with a rough and dirty odor. He opens his muzzle and lolls his tongue happily at you. "Lookin\' for a good time? I can keep ya busy, cutie!" he barks.',

Your face is shoved into his soft belly, and the stink of his unwashed fur washes over you. His large hands stroke over your back and down your sides, before he presses his muzzle against your neck, chest and crotch. His sniffing, nuzzling muzzle is ticklish and affectionate. You feel his wet nose slide down your belly, savouring your scent before you jump a little when he shoves his face firmly into your crotch. His long tongue slides out and licks up your thighs and around your crotch, and his hands roll you over so that he can sniff your rear. His affections are so eager that you barely have time to respond. You just grunt when you feel his cold nose slide along your tailhole, and then shudder when his expert tongue licks your rear and teases your hole.</p>You are pressed down on the wooden deck, the chubby wolf pressing down atop you as he licks up and down your ass. You squirm when his tongue curls and presses against your rear, and then you moan and shudder when you feel his tongue slip briefly inside you. Once you are thoroughly lubricated and slippery, you feel his thick cock sliding between your cheeks. He starts to hump and slide it up and down, hotdogging you while his fat belly bounces on your back. You hear his claws scraping against the wooden planks when he starts to get more excited, and then he howls a long, happy sound. You feel his hot ropes of cum spray along your back, in thick and messy spurts that drip down your sides.</p></p>For the rest of the trip, the dirty and smelly wolf sailors are all over you. You are woken up in the morning with a wolf licking your feet, his tail wagging. You will be eating dinner when one will offer you to eat his ass or suck his fat cock. Several times when walking along the deck, a wolf will grab you and shove your face deep into his damp sweaty armpit, or beg you to rub and jiggle his fat belly. While you are getting an eager butt-licking from one of the wolves, he admits to you that the whole crew are actually pirates. They never actually hurt anyone, but a few armpit-shoves tend to knock out most opponents with musk overdose.</p>Eventually, after you are well aquainted with the pirates and their various unique musks, you reach your destination. The ship travels up a river, and the pirates drop you off at the docks before carrying on with their journey. A whole gang of chubby pirates waves you off as they leave, their tails wagging, and you realise you will miss your new friends.',
