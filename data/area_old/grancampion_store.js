Your tongue moves instinctually, leaving nothing dry. As you continue to worship him, he lowers his tail over you, warming your body and keeping you in place.

Everett takes hold of his cock in one hand, slowly pumping it as you continue to nuzzle into him. </p>You can feel his body pulsing as you continue to make out with his tailhole. The rimjob is bringing him closer and closer to orgasm. Finally, as you press in even further, Everett gasps and unleashes thick ropes of cum. You faintly hear him uncork a vial to capture it as you continue to take in his scent and taste. You lose track of time, but eventually Everett softly pushes you away. You sit on the ground, dazed. The skunk hands you a vial of thick, white liquid. “You were so busy in the back, you missed all the action up front. Don’t worry, I saved a little for you.” You take the captured cum and slowly get back on your feet, but your head is still spinning from the skunk’s musk.

You decide that you could better appreciate the scent of his cum if you had it in you. With one hand, you start to stroke his cock.

The smell only makes you pump him harder.</p>\tFinally, Everett gives in and cums. You open your mouth, taking most of it down your throat while the rest splashes all over your nose and face.

He looks at you for a few seconds with what appears to be gentle concern but relents and hands you a vial.</p>\tUnlike most of the skunk’s perfumes, this one is not liquid. Instead, it is a smoky magenta gas. When you uncork the vial, all of the smoke rushes into your nostrils. You are stunned as the smell fills your sinuses and lungs. The harsh smoky scent makes it feel like a campfire has started in your throat.</p>\tYou realize you can’t feel your hands. When you raise them, you realise you can see right through your fingers. They’ve turned into a semi-transparent purple smoke-like gas. The change spreads up your arms. As your body morphs you seem to constantly switch between a solid and gaseous form. When the transformation reaches your genitals, you look on with disappointment as they fade away into the smoke.</p>\tWhen your whole body has turned to smoke, you worry you’ll never be able to smell any lovely scents again. Everett brings you comfort by coming over with a vial of his musk. He uncorks it, saying, “Don’t worry, hun. Now that you’re made of smoke, you can absorb smells!” Sure enough, his musk blends in with your smoky form and your body reeks of skunk scent. You embrace Everett as best you can. He breathes your smoke in deeply, happy to smell his own musk.",
