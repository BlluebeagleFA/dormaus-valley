                        "text": 'One of the merchants travelling through town is riding a strange beast, a huge yellow-feathered bird with a long neck and huge clawed feet. The bird is struggling and panting, and the human merchant in the saddle atop it is getting impatient. You jump with surprise as Flute the fox appears, a wide grin on his face and a glowing green potion in his hand. "Hello there traveller! I see your bird is struggling, well this potion is a rare one guaranteed to recover the stamina and strength of all mounts! Only two hundred gold!" he says. The merchant looks skeptical, but tosses a bag of gold to Flute, instructing him gruffly that he will pay dearly if this is a scam. </p>Flute walks up to the exhausted bird, pats its cheek, and guides the potion to its beak. The effects are rapid - a glow envelops both the bird and his rider, and the bird bucks in the air, throwing the merchant to the ground. The bird\'s feathers start to recede, revealing tanned, smooth skin. His legs shrink down, and his small wings stretch out, feathers turning to fingers and bones forming new muscle. His beak shrinks and softens into a handsome, surprised face. Meanwhile, the merchant squawks and scrabbles on the ground, his boots tearing open to reveal massive talons. His arms bend and shrink, as feathers sprout all over his skin, yellow and soft. His neck stretches up, and his face hardens into a wide, powerful beak. He squawks and yelps, but the naked former-bird just grabs the fallen saddle and straps it to the merchant\'s back. </p>"Many thanks, fox! Here, take the rest of my old master\'s cash. You earned it." he says. Flute catches a bag of gold as the former-bird tosses it, and watches the role-reversed pair trot off to market. "Another satisfied customer", he quips, before tossing you a couple of coins with a wink.',

A grinning, poorly-made scarecrow of sorts, with tattered clothes, and straw sticking out of his fabric \'skin\'. You walk over, and see that under his old hat, the face of the scarecrow is human! He whimpers at you, and you look down to see that the scarecrow\'s pole is sticking out from his rear, where the pants are torn open. </p>His body shudders and shifts, his head becoming round and simplistic, until his face transforms into an unmoving, painted-on smile. Once the scarecrow stops moving, Mikhail emerges from the store and hangs a sign on his neck. It reads \'THIEVES GET PUNISHED\'. Of course, it\'s not theft if you take it from an object. You swipe the former human\'s money pouch before you go.',

"No fightin\'." he says, with gruff finality. </p>You look down at the human to see his pants have been torn open, and his ass is leaking thick, sticky cum that stinks of Grizz\'s masculine musk. From the pained but confused expression of pleasure on the barely-conscious man\'s face, you are not sure if he considers his \'punishment\' to be a good thing or not. He flops backwards and passes out, a few coins rolling from his palms onto the road.',
